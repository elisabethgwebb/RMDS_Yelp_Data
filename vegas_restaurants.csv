First visit I tried the smoked turkey, good smoke flavor and moist.  I also had to try the brisket, was impressed that they asked if I wanted lean or fatty brisket.  I chose the fatty brisket as it would hopefully have more flavor.  Was not disappointed, just the right amount of marveling, great mesquite smoke flavor and a hearty bark on the edges.

This second trip I had to try the brisket again to check for consistency, and I really enjoyed again.  Had a couple slices of the tri-tip and that too was good.  My only let down so far was the beef rib.  Flavor was good, but they were borderline chewy and were mostly bone ... these were not the heavy duty beef ribs that you get in the hill country of Texas... Or the beef ribs that Rollin Smoke is serving up here in Vegas.

I'll have go back and try the baby back ribs next time.

The free shit that they bombard you with is plenty to fill up on, and it's all delicious. Though, I've been here a few times, always hoping and anticipating something different, though it never is.  Many of the specials are the same, (though, perhaps Its because I find myself in Vegas at the beginning and end of summer, more than any other season, so perhaps its just dependent on what's in season... That's a fair thought, right?)

I have genuinely enjoyed every meal that I've had here, and typically shove too much food in my face.  It's all very flavorful.

The complaint that I would have with this place, is that their wine menu is stupid expensive... Their mark-up on them is astronomical... Probably 500%+, But, I can accept that, getting hunks of parm, bruschetta, zuccini, mussels, grappa, a selection of breads, salamis, and whatever else I may be forgetting, as compliments of the house.

Cookies and creme - served with a giant ice cream sandwich (who says you cant have dessert before dinner??) and super sweet and delicious. This drink is dangerous since you can barely taste the alcohol in it.

We finally got a chance to go there to celebrate of my mom's 60th birthday. I've read lots good reviews about it and had very high expectation. It took us awhile to realize that Sterling is not a restaurant. It's located inside Bally's steakhouse. I personally prefer to enjoy my Sunday brunch in a bright and open spaced restaurant (so I can enjoy the sunshine). Since Sterling is located inside a traditional steakhouse, I bet you can just imagine how this place is even with all the lights on full blast. Let's talk about food now. Crab claws and legs were very fresh and crab meat was sweet and succulent. Lamb chop was really good! It was tendered and perfectly cooked with their special mint sauce. Caviar that you can get from sushi bar was okay quality. It did meet my expectation since this is AYCE. However, I was very disappointed with the over cooked lobster tail!! I just felt like they could do so much better since this is a Sunday brunch with $90 per person!!! There was nothing really wowed me from dessert bar.

Baba ganoush was light and a bit smokey flavor.  best i have tasted.  Pastilla is interesting - a filo pastry filled with ground almonds and chicken- sweet and savory and good.  Entrees of spicy shrimp (huge) and baked fish (with potatoes and peppers).  Both entrees were so flavorful and cooked perfectly.  I got the braised chard because of all the recommendations on yelp.

The inside is much bigger which is nice since there was always a wait at the old spot, but there's still a wait here.  Overall the inside felt bland.  I don't know if they're still decorating or not but it just didn't have that ""thai"" feel.  I wasn't impressed at all.

I ordered a few items for a friend and I to share and needless to say we were both disappointed.  The Thai beef jerky was decent but I've had much better at several other places.  The larb was pretty horrible.  It was so chalky from whatever seasoning they used that it was unenjoyable.  There was also hardly any cabbage and unlike every other larb I've ever had, you couldn't taste a hint of lime or freshness. 

The Pad Thai was really flavorful but I've never ordered Pad Thai and had such a small portion that it's almost impossible to share with 1 other person.  The noodles were also stuck together which essentially made it 2 bites.  As good as the flavor was, it wasn't worth the price.  

The last item we got which my friend wanted was  Nua Sao (#56).  I've never had this before but it was beyond delicious.  Essentially it's grilled steak served over cabbage with a peanut based dipping sauce.  This is the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars and not 2.

b_dZQ7RrGpeOtWpHHEozxw,0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,qjnJFZtsY_nfRzoL3J_UWQ,4,11,4,9,"Review #911

   Owing to the fact that NY-NY featured a Memorial to the victims of 9/11 by the Statue of Liberty up to 2013, it is appropriate that this is going to be my review 911. Likewise owing to the facts that my family and I vacationed there for a week in March and that it is frequent spot to hang out at, the time has come to review New York-New York.

   New York-New York and the real New York share something else besides landmarks. Both are exciting and have Pizzazz!  

  The first time I ever set eyes on New York-New York was on a summer afternoon back in July 1996 when the MGM was the hot new property on the Strip. Because it was being built, I couldn't set foot in it. The next year when we returned to Las Vegas, it was my first time in the casino. Nearly 20 years later, the property has not aged. The thing about theme casinos that some bean executives just don't understand is that a great theme never gets old. Additionally fantastic themes are so exciting that it puts the reviewer at a disadvantage of streamlining to avoid the character limit. For that reason this review from this point forward separates it by category. 

Hotel Rooms:

  Our hotel room up in the Columbia Tower was clean and comfortable. The neat thing about the theme is that the towers resemble the New York skyline. Because my dad paid for it the few things I could say about pricing is that it is competitively priced before the resort fee. The view from the room overlooked the Statue of Liberty and southeast Valley. The roller coaster would careen up and down the track outside the tower. 

Drinking:

   The coffee fan in me appreciates that it is easy to savor the beverage. By registration, Fornaio serves a delicious Cafe Americano and desserts. There are two Starbuck's with one that has seats overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge. 

  The alcohol fan in me appreciates the variety of bars. There is the Irish Bar near the Strip. Upstairs for a different drinking environment is Coyote Ugly. In the casino is a central bar and sporadic cocktail service at the slot machines. The pizza place has a $7.77 special including 2 slices and beer. The Times Square Bar is a fun spot for a cold one while listing to Dueling Piano players duel it out. 

Dining:

   There is a nice choice of places to eat. The themed streets of Greenwich Village are a unique spot to enjoy a bite while taking in the attention that is so detailed that steam rises out of a manhole replica on the walkway. The restaurants include a fish & chips place, a crepe stand, Greenberg's Deli, Chinese restaurant, hot dog stand, Broadway Burger and pizza place. Way out in Coney Island there is a Nathan's that is the only one to serve super cheeseburgers on the Strip. Near the hotel registration America is the casino cafe. Upstairs in the menazzaine the restaurants include a pizzeria and Haagan Daez. Out in the suburbs are Tom Urban and Shake Shack. 

Entertainment :

   The theme is the major entertainment. It makes this a unique place that is unparalleled at a New York theme. Before I step foot in the casino, there is the New York skyline, Statue of Liberty, and the Brooklyn Bridge. The theme continues inside. Even Hershey's World gets in the New York mood with a towering chocolate Statue of Liberty. There has been some detheming in the Central Park casino where the trees have been replaced with contemporary furnishings. This causes the eye to look across the casino to the perimeter. Usually my eyes lead me to Greenwich Village. At night the sounds of the Times Square Dueling Piano Bar bounce across the Village. Throughout the day and night the New York roller coaster cars fly along the tracks above. Above Times Square there is entertainment to be had in the Coney Island arcade. In back of the hotel, there is a resort swimming pool that overlooks the roller coaster and Monte Carlo. The hotel us also the home of the Cirque Du Soleil show: Zumanity. The entertainment got even better with the newly opened Park connecting the casino to the T-Mobile Arena. 

Conclusion:

   New York-New York is the quintessential proof that well-run  properties with fantastic themes never get old. They remain exciting places that never get boring. Fantastic themed hotels in comparison to hotels that try to be hip or overluxurious alleviate the negative energy of paying to park, obnoxious resort fees, and other expenses. New York - New York puts me in a New York State of Mind.",6/10/2016 3:51,36.1257827,-115.2411281,"6850 W Spring Mountain Rd, Ste 12",NV,Las Vegas,89146,"Desserts, Coffee & Tea, Food",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Tiffany Coffee

I will not ever use there services again. This is strictly based on the companies treatment of customers . In September I made my payment Online via Checking. Watched it sit in pending for 4 Days , then got threatened with auction due to ""insufficient funds"" ... the funds where sitting in my bank. The bank let me know the storage never applied the funds. Also I work at a bank . I'm well aware of how checking transactions work. And yes my funds where available and authorized . Despite that I was charged a lien fee , and the manager refused to waive it . Now that I'm finally moving a few days into the new month , the company refuses to let me pay just the few days I'll be occupying the unit , they want the full month.

I ordered the Pork Shank to see if would be just as greasy this time, as soon as it was placed on the table I removed the shank from on top of the rice to the side to prevent the fat from moving down to the rice.  Good idea.  JB ordered the salmon and loved it.  Our companions ordered Filet Mignon (requested Med/Rare, it came Med/Well) and the red snapper.  Both got ok reviews, not great.  They do have Lambrusco, which is a summer wine favorite of mine and hard to find on most wine menus.  This is a plus.

I came into town for a short trip house hunting, on our last night my grandma sent me and my mom on our own to look for food (older people are set in their ways and eat dinner at a certain time so I get it) My mom and I were drained mentally and physically so we didn't feel like going out of the way for something to eat. I figure you can't go wrong with Denny's its my go to when I'm back home so I didn't think it would be bad!

So when we first walked in, a super friendly male manager greeted us and sat us at a table, I figured that went so smoothly that it set a good tone for the rest of our meal.. WRONG! After we chatted a bit and he said our waiter would be right with us it's as if he disappeared into orbit, I never saw him again! I only saw ONE waitress who was slammed with tables as time went on! She was stuck with a good 7-9 tables, and people just kept coming in! 

It was so unfair for her to be left alone juggling a thousand different things. I heard other employees in the kitchen but no one ever came out, just the ONE waitress who was left to die pretty much! My mom ordered the ""senior club"" which is what she's usually had in the past but when her food came out it was like something totally different! First off, her hashbrowns had the whole onion chopped up on top! When she usually asks for ""onions and cheese"" she wasn't expecting that! She had to scrape off quite a bit of onions! Her ""club"" sandwich was anything but! Her turkey was served hot, giant pieces of RAW red onion and sad, pathetic looking bread! 

Our waitress took so long in between checking on us that my mom was turned off by her food that she didn't even finish it. Now I'm sure this will be the closest Denny's to me when I do move here, I just hope and pray they have more staff the next time I come in!

""Halo Halo is a popular Filipino cold dessert which is a concoction of crushed ice, evaporated milk and various ingredients including, among others, ube, sweetened beans, coconut strips, sago, gulaman (seaweed gelatin), pinipig rice, boiled root crops in cubes, fruit slices, flan, and topped with a scoop of ice cream."" -wikipedia

Came here with my girlfriend and her 7- year old daughter on a Sunday for the all you can eat for 12.99 per person ( they charged her daughter 10.99 ) We read online that they had two menus, but upon arriving they handed us one menu that was missing many items that was supposed to be on the second menu.That made me a bit apprehensive, and while I was trying to decide if it was still worth it, an older Asian woman encouraged us to sit and asked us what we wanted to drink -I told her Thai tea, but she insisted on a different tea-she said it would be very good-so I went along with what she recommended. While we were looking over the menu (since it was not a buffet already laid out ) the woman again very strongly encouraged us to order two of anything so "" we wouldn't take all day"" . We ordered -as she insisted- two of each -egg rolls , chicken wings, potstickers, rice , and one bowl of pho. Everything we ordered was very small-usually just two or three pieces EXCEPT for the rice which was piled high on a big plate-enough to fill 5-6 people. After eating all of our food except for only being able to eat about a quarter of the rice plate,I asked for the check (since we were all stuffed) The woman then proceeded to tell me I had to finish eating the rice or I would be charged for another separate order. I thought she was joking, but she then said that I was wasting their food and I had to pay if I didn't eat it! Talk about cheap!! First of all they didn't even have all the items on the menu ( false advertising to get you inside) and then they don't have any food prepared (as in a buffet) then they PUSH you to order too much( I wanted to just try one of each thing at first in case I didn't like it) . Then they try to trick you by making you pay for whatever you can't eat!!? The woman said she told me when I ordered that I would have to pay extra if I didn't eat it all (TOTAL LIE!)
Needless to say-I was angry and told her I wasn't paying extra-my total for three people for LUNCH was already $50 , and it was not good at all -then I am given a total con line that I would expect at the strip from a street criminal!

He kept raving about how everyone thinks it's one of the best buffet ever and the food was off the chart. This cry baby was so bummed when we couldn't make it in time for the buffet because they were closing in 30 minutes and they didn't let customers stay after closing time. 

So the last time I was in Vegas I decide to check this place out. The restaurant itself was very elegant and classy. The way the food was place on the dish was a work of art. A lot of the dish looks too pretty to be eaten. 

So you can guess my surprise when I tasted a couple of item on my plate and was blown away. How tasteless! I couldn't believe it I just paid $47 for a buffet that wasn't that special. I wouldn't go back unless someone pays for my meal and even if they did offer I'll try to talk them out of it. 

I think the only dish I did enjoy was this Shrimp in this tomato sauce that was serve in a little mini pan. That was it. Everything else was... blah.

I'm bummed that I spend $47 for the buffet and I treated my two younger sisters, maybe I went on a day that was off but whatever the case is; I'm not a fan and I had better. 

The service was great. Our waiter kept coming back to check up on us and the dish boy was fast! He kept taking plates that was finish and some that weren't.

Cartridge was expeditiously replaced.

I later remembered a second minor plumbing problem with my kitchen faucet.  Chance provided education by informing me that Moen products have a lifetime warranty, and advised I could inform the company of my faucet replacement need along with photos.  The local hardware store near my house did not have the small part needed for incised the faucet, so he committed to returning the next day with it from another location.  Chance kept his word and arrived at the time frame he previously stated.

The work was done quickly and professionally.  Chance was respectful of my home and property.   Chance was clean, groomed and professionally dressed.   At all times, Chance was professional and took care of matters efficiently.

Service: The staff greeted me quickly and were very attentive overall. A family came in five minutes after me, ordered after me and received both their spring rolls and entrees before mine. They appeared to know the staff, but still seemed off especially because I was dining by myself. 

Atmosphere: very clean, open and inviting. Choice of seats at a bar, tables or booths. I was a little hesitant about the food because the menu was kind of a mess. A lot of items were crossed off in black marker which seemed odd since it just opened and the pictures in the menu did not look appealing at all, especially the picture of the spring rolls. I was also disappointed that all of the pho options were beef only. No chicken, seafood or meatless options to be seen. There was a large range of noodle options though which was nice. Also surprised that they did not serve boba (crossed off) and Thai tea was nowhere on the menu.

Food: I ordered the spring rolls and flank and brisket pho. The spring rolls were really good, very fresh! I wish they were served with mint leaves but as they were they were still quite good. The pho itself was pretty good, I'd give it a 7.5/10. Great flavor. My biggest complaint was that there were way too many onions, there actually were more onions than beef.

They have a nice menu with breakfast and lunch selections. The menu includes a lot of coffee and tea selections as well as fresh juice. They offer pressed coffee  as well. They have indoor and outdoor seating. 
I chose the egg croissant with added mushrooms for an extra $1.00. My husband chose the baguette panini egg with added ham for $1.00. 
As we were standing in line there was a gentleman in front of me whom ordered the chocolate twist made from a croissant into a long, skinny pastry loaded with rich chocolate and cream. We added that to order too as there was only two left on the backing sheet behind the nice lady whom helped us sitting on the counter. 
We added hot coffee to our order with rich cream and brown sugar. 
We sat outside and shortly our pastry and hot coffee was brought to us. It was beyond delicious! The pastry was rich, creamy and flaky. The coffee was excellent and paired nicely with our pastry.

After being wowed at the CMYE at the new location in Henderson, I jumped for joy when Smashburger came up on Groupon. Only having 30 days to use the Groupon, we dropped in when we were sort of in their neck of the woods since this is a bit out of the way for me.

Located near the University, next door to In and Out and across the street from Cafe Rio, it is surrounded by all of my favorites. The restaurant was clean and there were a few but not many people eating. We had no problem using the Groupon and knew right what we wanted: The Vegas Burger, The Truffle Mushroom Swiss Burger, Fried Pickles, a Blue Moon and a Fat Tire.

The beer was brought to our table and we were offered frosty mugs - why yes of course! I love that! The food came out shortly after. It tasted much like I remembered with 2 distinct differences. 1) the Vegas Burger had PILES of sauteed onions! UGH... I like a little bit of onion, but this had seriously about 1/4 cup of them piled on and melted into the cheese... way too much! 2) both burgers were extremely greasy! That was one thing we noted during the CMYE, the burgers were juicy but not greasy. In fact, the owner had touted that they taught the cooks to sear in the juices so it wouldn't be greasy. Also, they toast the bun to keep the bun from getting soggy... well, that was not our experience. I enjoyed the fried pickles however.

Word to the wise Groupon takes like 30-40 of the amount made for themselves, so a lot of business would prefer to honor the price so they make more money. But anywhoooo (lol) when I called they said yes they would honor the price and in fact give me a better deal. I was totally hype. I brought up the fact that yelp says that they are pretty booked out. The guy said yeah they are typically booked out but he actually had a cancellation that afternoon and if I could make it in at 4pm they could do it that day. I was off for the day so I told him yeah that would work and be dope! 

I booked the 4pm appointment and went about my way. About an hour later they called to say an appointment was running super late and if I wanted to I could come as soon as I was free. I was just finishing up my errands so I told them I could be there in 30 and headed out that way.

They guy that helped me was super informative and gave me some good suggestions on percentages for the tint. I settled on a color and they got it started. It took the full estimated 2 hours but that's why they quote that time right? So far I'm a week out from the tint and I love it! My car is so much cooler and my young daughter likes not having the sun in her face all the time!

The Oyster Bar has a true following--and if you attempt to eat here, be prepared for a bit of wait.  The counter doesn't serve more than 20 (at most!) at a time--but I assure you--it's worth the wait.  

Regardless of what you order--their dishes are cooked to order directly in front of you--and you will have to do everything in your power to not drool all over your setting.  Each dish is loaded with tons of seafood.  Combine with with the butter, spices, and base they let cook in front of you--and your poor stomach will sit in gluttonous anticipation for the next 20 minutes.  

I've been here twice--each time ordering the Etouffee. It's amazing!  It's a wonderful creole/french soup that's wonderfully spiced and loaded with seafood.  It's the less creamy version of the Oyster Bar's Pan Roast.  I happen to enjoy the soup more because it's less rich than the Pan Roast--but I've had the Pan Roast--and it's certainly nothing to scoff at.  It's amazing!  Just a tad too rich for me.

You can spice up your dishes the way you like.  I like my spice and generally order a 7.  Spicy, but still enjoyable.  I've tasted an 8...and while delicious...definitely left me gulping down a lot more water than I wanted.  

I've seen orders of the shrimp scampi and the linguine a la vongole--and i can tell you that even in my bloated state, wanted to order them. They look crazy good.

Overall not a bad facility, I did not like the look of the basketball courts, real small, courts were both tweaked.  I had inquired multiple times about fixing them, so we can continue to play, after months, nothing seemed worked on.  The most recent time I went here on 8/8/2018, I had brought my brother along to try a 3 day pass & eventually sign him up for a membership.  We are originally from California, & are in the process of getting our local ID cards, didn't read the small lettering on our part, but we got to the gym to get things started & here comes Assistant Sales Manager Tim Bathan.  We show up & the 1st thing I notice is he's talking with another employee & they're talking about how another employee had not shown up or called in & he already seemed irritated at that point.  No one acknowledged us when we came in, signed in, & checked in my brother with his pass.  Tim addresses us with a dismissive manner from the beginning & the first thing he says to my brother is ""If you don't have a local ID or a bill on you, you will be paying $25 today"".  At first we walked away because no way is anyone paying that, before it used to be $10 for the day & now its $25.  But after walking out & knowing we just drove to a further gym than what is to around our area, I just referred this gym to my brother about how good it is, & than this guy just completely dismisses us, rather than trying to work with us or give additional options to prove our residency (It's a 3-day pass, he can't sign on legal documents & update ID or local bill, & wouldn't accept electronic proof, had to be physical documentation).  I let him know how unprofessional that was & the whole time he looked at me with that same dismissive look & kept saying ""okay, mmhmm, okay"" asked him for his full name & he pointed at his name tag at first which is only his first name!  Dude was a straight unprofessional as a ""Assistant SALES Manager"".  We left, went to the Village Center Cir location, brought a local bill with us, but kept it in our pocket to see if this was a company wide manner that they address potential members & Robert the Sales Manager proved that theory was wrong.  He took care of us asked us where we lived, got personal with us to see what would work best for us, & sure enough after saying we would try the facility & the 3 day pass, we signed him up & have been at that location ever since.

How cool is Las Vegas Weekly? 

I will tell you how cool: pretty very fucking cool!

They published an issue with Daft fucking Punk on their cover when 99% of the valley had no inkling of a clue that the frenchmen were performing in the city and even less knew what Vegoose was. Shit: 99% of the valley's residents today possess no clue that Daft Punk performed a full set live for the very last time on U.S. soil in Las Vegas or that we ever had a festival called Vegoose.

In fact, I wanted the issue to mat and frame since I gave away the magazines that I snagged and there was definitely no better souvenir from the show. So, I email someone at LVW and ask to buy one ... a back issue ... and they are so cool that they offered to just give it to me. Unfortunately, I got sidetracked getting all excited about the prospect and looking for materials to do it myself, that I never followed through yet typing this review reminds me that my wall needs a Las Vegas Weekly framed behind museum archival glass.

Every single time I have visited Las Vegas Weekly offices (verify the check-ins), every single representative of the publication has been helpful, even when it is just helping out an avid longtime reader who is lost on campus because they've recently relocated their offices for the third time.

Pro Tip: They put on a lot of contests and I think people seldom enter them because I win a lot of them. Or, perhaps they enjoy me travelling to shitty Henderson that often. I am not even sure why I share this: it's going to be zero giveaway wins for me from now on.

Final Thought™
Daft Punk is playing in my house.

The waitress sent out crappy vibes to us the entire night. Our meal started off with her spilling water on one of our friends.

t3wdGouv1u8VkX9o-oJUcw,YgzjhRYTQXyOMFXHYG_2RQ,PpD_gfjcw5nsjRmFeAR3_Q,1,2,0,0,"I really want to impress on readers how this restaurant has gone downhill within the last couple of years.  Nanay Gloria's on Maryland Parkway used to be a good deal for your dollar, but things have changed, and I feel, it's to save money as much as possible.  Firstly, if you have children between the ages of 1-3 years old, they will be charged.  It doesn't sound like a lot--$1.99, but more respectable buffet eateries don't usually subscribe to such practices.  Still, they didn't use to do this.  Secondly, they've gotten rid of trays.  Yes, trays.  This is a cafeteria style buffet line, and you are expected to fill your plate and carry it to your table by hand.  That means multiple trips back to get water and your silverware.  God forbid that you happen to be carrying soup...and with a kid in tow.  Talk about an accident waiting to happen.  I honestly feel they got rid of the trays to discourage customers from filling their plates.  I actually asked them why they got rid of them, and no one could give me a decent answer.  But, trays are just practical at any eatery, and I strongly condemn this restaurant for  getting rid of them.  I've always liked their kare-kare (ox-tail and tripe in a peanuty broth) which is always complemented by a sauteed shrimp paste (known as ginisang bagoong).  I remember how I used to love their sauteed shrimp paste.  Now, it tastes as if the shrimp paste is coming straight from the jar without being sauteed.  The pancit was left wanting, as it was more noodle than anything.  There were big chunks of the ""rootier"" parts of the cabbage--not the leafy part, and it left the dish tasting too bitter.   Their curried chicken at the time I dined there, had veggies that were undercooked, and I happened to scoop up the chicken's neckbone, which, in my opinion, wasn't going to do a ravenous diner any favors.  Do they expect that I'll be sucking on a length of neckbone just to lap up the last bits of curry?  If they want to add it for flavoring, they should remove it prior to serving.  The dessert items are very limited.  They always have a hot dessert on the food line, but the selection of fruits and other sweets were very limited.  Trying to sit down to a clean table was almost impossible.  Even the cleanest table that we were at felt sticky to the touch.

Unfortunately, upon sitting down, I saw their happy hour was a completely different time frame, so we asked our server, Jordyn, about their happy hour. We told her that when we called, we got a different answer, and she said she would ask management if maybe they had another special going on. In the quick five minutes, not only did she find out what happened (the hostess was new and wasn't clear on times) but she spoke to her manager about the miscommunication and was able to get us happy hour priced appetizers. That showed that she truly cared about the service she gave to her customers AND was able to fix it! In such a quick manner as well!

 My boyfriend and I were originally debating on staying because we were a little upset, but this definitely displayed great customer service and I knew that Jordyn will surely take care of us. We ended up ordering poke nachos, calamari, the carnivore pizza, and 2 tacos (kbbq and a fish taco). The food was delicious as always! Yardhouse is always my favorite chain restaurant. 
We also ordered 2 micheladas each. After the first round, Jordyn said another bartender just clocked in that makes amazing micheladas and ensured she would make ours. She was very attentive and very clearly catered to us! 

When it was time to pay out our check, not only did Jordyn remember our discounted appetizers, but she was able to comp them completely off!

Whoever is hiring these great individuals needs a raise! My boyfriend and I walked in at 9:50pm (They close at 10pm) and they were absolutely phenomenal! Starting with the manager Gab! I asked for half a pizza and a salad they had already cleaned and put away the salads but he insisted he could still make me one... I said it was okay and he nicely offered a complimentary dessert for the inconvenience! It's a build your own pizza, you can do half a pizza too, FRESH ingredients, so many different options with sauces, gluten free friendly, very clean. Brittany was at the register, she was absolutely amazing as well, very friendly again even though it was about 7 minutes till closing and another couple walked in after us, still with friendly faces on their face!

This restaurant is located off Strip at the Palace Station. I recalled we'd been here before when it was ""The Broiler"". They knocked out a few walls, added some pretty lighting, some super comfortable booths...and ""Voila!"", the steakhouse has been resurrected as The Charcoal Room.  A very nice improvement.

As we walked into the restaurant we noticed a comfortable Bar Area and a beautiful wine rack display to our right. Once we were seated we were offered a basket of assorted breads (Pretzel bread was my favorite). Everything on the menu looked good but we settled on the Atlantic Salmon and the Filet. The salmon was good but the Filet Mignon was excellent. Nothing beats a perfectly cooked Filet, in my book! It was deliciously charred on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. 

We liked the staff. They were professional and polite on this particular weeknight and not too busy to check on us regularly. We will definitely be back.

The Cons: The restaurant is located in one of Stations Casino's older properties.

Oh right, I work for the next year on the side of I-15 and was hungry and in the company of construction guys. For them, this little truck stop diner was just the gem they were looking for.

Upon entry there was no hostess, so we ended up seating ourselves in a little side room. Fortunately, we didn't wait long and were greeted by an energetic waitress with a fabulous attitude. If nothing else, I must say I was extremely impressed by the service in this joint. Our waitress had a great disposition and was funny as hell. I found this quite refreshing as the service in Vegas has really gone downhill with bitchiness as of late. 

As a gluten free vegan, there really wasn't anything I could eat here. I was really hungry though, so I braved the home fries and a bowl of plain oatmeal. I can definitely say they tried pretty hard to accommodate considering my dietary restrictions; a cook even came out from the back to confirm that olive oil on the potatoes would be ok. That was a nice, and unexpected, surprise considering most restaurants don't care as they should. 

Overall, the ambiance is quite kitschy, the food is average, but the service is superb.

The windows, bright lights, and open space offers a very inviting atmosphere.  Really modern feel to it, with really cute furniture throughout. I like the gelato/dessert area.  It had a little open window from the outside where it looks like you can order, kind of like serendipity.  Not sure if its just there for show, but I like the idea.

I'm giving this place a three mainly for the decor/atmosphere, but the food is nothing really to write home about.  I read every single review written for meatball spot prior to me coming in.  Even with all the negative reviews, I still came in with an open mind and was actually excited to check it out!

First off, I think the hostesses all looked really nice dressed in black!  When I got inside the blue jeans and meatball spot t-shirt I was greeted with was less than appealing.  I felt like it didn't go with the restaurant at all.  Being greeted with such fashionable looking hostesses, then a waitress in jeans and a t-shirt was kind of off putting.

Anyway, our server, Bunny, was delightful.  I'm happy that I didn't experience the horrible service everyone else yelped about.  She was prompt, not rude, and made nice conversation.

Onto the food.  I ordered their three meatballs (I guess they finally invested in new menus).  Got them in classic with the pesto sauce.  I also ordered a chicken meatball brioche with a special jalapeño sauce they were featuring.  I tried the apple salad, mac n cheese and a cookie milkshake for dessert.

The meatballs were extremely salty!!!  It didn't help that it was served with the pesto sauce, which didn't taste like pesto, and was also salty.  It took us a long time to eat the three meatballs.  The piece of bread it was served with was cold, soggy, and hard all at the same time.  I almost chipped a tooth biting into it.  Forreal!  My chicken meatball brioche was ok.  It wasn't as salty, but I think it's cause it was served in between bread.  The jalapeño sauce was ok, it had a little kick to it.  

The salad was really boring and had very little topping. It was mainly sauce and spinach. I think they should add more cheese, apples, and pecans.  The Mac n cheese was not very good.  I think they need to change the cheese they are using. Seriously reminded me of Kraft Mac n cheese in the box.  Apparently this dish is homemade, I think they need to redo the recipe.  Lastly, the cookie milkshake!!!  They put too much Hershey's syrup, but it was ok.  I prefer thick milkshakes, like the ones they have at steak and shake, or burger bar.  This one was really airy and frothy.  I didn't finish it.

On the menu it said they offered pizza by the slice at the counter.  I wanted to order one just to try, but they weren't serving any.  Overall, I think this place is seriously over priced for what they are serving.  $8 for the meat ball trio, $4 for the meatball brioche, $7 for 1/2 a salad, $6 for Mac n cheese, and $6 for the shake.  

This place is very family oriented and I think it will be their saving grace.  It got pretty busy with families and their kids around dinner time. 
 
Anyway...
-I like the decor. 
-I like that I have a new option for food in Town Square.

But...
-Their menu is super limited.  
-Their meatballs are too salty (chicken and classic at least).
-And I just think its too expensive.
-I'll come back to try the pizzas, cause it did look good, but I'm not in a hurry to do so.
-Maybe if they do some type of happy hour menu... Then I'll come back sooner!

*I just noticed that some people added cheese, eggs, or whatever on their meatballs.  I didn't know this was an option! I didn't see any ""additional toppings"" on the menu, and my server failed to give me the heads up.  So, there ya go!

Forget Fat Tuesday! I agree, they are SO played out and overrated! Evening Call is the shyttt!

You can find Evening Call in many different hotels on the Strip: Planet Hollywood, Luxor, Paris, Bally's,Mandalay Bay and Rio!

Every time I walked by one of these spots I couldn't help but get a refill.

I truly enjoyed coming to this location because of the BOMB customer service. My bartender Myron was TRULY amazing and made my experience at Evening Call a blast. He gave me tips on what drinks to miss and even what shot will be perfect in my drink. 

This location is small with only a table and chair. It's more of, ""get your glass and keep walking"" type of deal but I like that!

DRINKS:
Drink choices are legit! My favorite was the Mai Tai with Rum! I'm not even a Rum drinker but that drink was off the chain!
They serve a large variety of different flavors of Margarita slushies''! I LOVED them all! Although the brain freeze was uh killa! I was still able to manage...Whoo...Don't forget an extra shot for $2. Its Vegas so why not!

PRICES:
They have such a great variety of drinks! The prices are indeed cheap for what normal drinks in Vegas truly cost. The 17oz cup is $8, 22oz Mood is $10,the 25oz is $11, the 32oz. is only $14 and the next size up is only $17, which is the super 50oz. $10 for a refill in the same cup so KEEP YOUR CUP TO USE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE TIME YOUR IN VEGAS! 
CUSTOMER SERVICE:

The workers here are totally sweet and nice! They are VERY strict about children being around any type of alcohol so please don't bring your children in this joint. You will be asked to leave.

FREE:
Tasters are FREE! You can taste as much as you want before making a choice. I was also able to mix and match my flavors as well! Sweet!

If you are close and see this spot! You MUST stop!!

This review is for those who are uninsured. Initially, I went to Walgreen's Clinic since my case was not severe. However, the NP thought it would be a good idea for me to go to ER (since she prob didn't want any responsibilities). She told me to go to UMC or St. Rose and of course she was like St. Rose has a fast track and there's no wait. I was more concerned about how much it was going to cost me. She then said oh St. Rose should be cheaper (NOT!!!) I should give that NP a NEGATIVE STAR! 

Long story short""er"":
There was a wait (slightly short than UMC Quickcare).
The front desk lady had no clue about the est. medical bill. I know they don't know how severe my case is and what procedures might be necessary but COME ON give me a dam min. estimate which is UHMMMM HELLO 250 for the visit and 250 to see the doctor. SO THERE YOU HAVE IT! AT THE BARE MINIMUM 500 TO ""VISIT"" THE ER WITH NO INSURANCE! IT DOES NOT TAKE A GENIUS OR A PSYCHIC TO FIGURE THIS OUT! She just kept telling me lame excuses like well you can pay 250 or not and you might not even have to pay that. WHAT?! She made no sense whatsoever.

My visit:
Sat on a bench in the hall way for 50 minutes. Worst part of the wait was that they were not that busy. (Description of how busy they were: two people before me were for minor things like flu/fever/cold symptoms and after me, a little boy broke his arm. Doctor sits with me for 2 minutes, reads my print out, and asks if I had any questions. I wait another 30 minutes before a nurse checks me out. They forgot that I was patiently waiting in the hallway... I had to constantly ask the nurse or a staff that passed by to find my nurse or doctor so I can get checked out (which was very irritating). She gives me a pill, I sign the discharge, and I pay 250 for the visit. 

Verdict:
A month later I get a bill for around 250 for the Doctor who sat with me for 2 minutes to read the print out that I could have or the nurse could have read. 

Week after receiving this bill (I thought that was it), I received another bill for 1700!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Minus the uninsured discount which made it 1500! ARE YOU SERIOUS! You charge me for a bed that I did not get to lay in and diagnosis which was already diagnosed by the NP and myself!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and WHY DID YOU NEVER MENTION THAT THE ONE PILL THAT YOU GAVE ME WAS OVER A 100!!!!!!!!! WHEN CLEARLY, I WAS HEADING TO THE PHARMACY TO GET THE EXACT SAME PILL FOR 20 BUCKS FOR 6 PILLS WITH NO INSURANCE!

We had NO idea what to expect, so we were seated & sat around like goons for a minute (despite the fact that the restaurant has a big placard right inside the front door describing what to expect).  

As mentioned in most reviews, this is a prix fixe menu (about $40 a person) serving six courses.  No menu necessary.  

Everything was very good.  The highlight was the 'salad' (really more of an appetizer plate, but described on the menu as salad, and served as the third course), with beets, carrots, hummus, tzatziki, and olives.  Loved it.  The steak skewers were also fabulous.  The chicken and couscous was pretty bland, but by that time, we were so stuffed with great food that we could forgive this.

Also worth note - the dessert.  Holy cow.  I'm not a big fan of dessert, but this was amazing...a huge plate of something similar to baklava.  Lots of phyllo dough with walnuts, honey, some type of fruit (pear?  apple?) and baked.  And lots of it!  Yyeeaahh!!!

I was looking for someone who was closer to me and who I can trust! Let's be honest these are my lashes! I work at 4:00am with a super busy schedule. I don't have time to do my makeup. Let's be real with each other! I am not getting up to impress at that time of morning. I was going to someone else but she was way to far and I wanted someone who only did lashes. I loved from the moment I text Angela, it was a quick response. Not only did she quickly respond but, she was super sweet and genuine. When you walk into her little ""lash salon"" you are immediately comforted by the calming energy. She has nice relaxing music going on. A cute little cabinet to place my belongings in. Now the best part. She had you take off your shoes and right away she explains her process and what you're looking for. You lay comfortably down, and she places a nice blanket on you. She explains that this is my time to relax and meditate or even take a nap! She doesn't talk, she likes to focus on her work. Which I absolutely love! My lashes look so amazing and it's been a week since I've seen her. Usually by now I am panicking trying to make an appointment to get a fill. I love the fact that she doesn't do fills. I think it more sanitary. Now, I thought it was a little pricy at first. However, by the time I continue to get fills it adds up to be the same.

I first went over a wall and the door was locked.  That's the back and it's not the entrance.  I then tried to walk around only to be met by a large piece of paneling firmly in place.  Back to the wall and two of us tried another way.

Do enter by the stairs that take you to the plaza around which all the stores and shops face.  That's where you get to the entrance of Kitchen Table Squared.  Well, in any case, it helped build our appetites along with our stamina!

We were seated in the right rear of the restaurant.  The place is very modern and quite good looking.  We looked at the menus and found out there was a reverse happy hour in effect for some of the food and for the drinks.  Our server was great at letting us know about the happy hour.

I ordered an iced tea, a cup of potato soup (they were out of their crab bisque--damn) and the pulled pork BBQ sandwich with coleslaw and duck fat fries.

Preparation time was standard which gave us time to catch up on upcoming trips and other things.

The potato soup was good.  It had cream, celery, onion, bacon, carrot, and fried potato skin ground into the soup.  A little bit later, our mains came.  My pulled pork was good but it's something I should learn not to order.  I'm not a BBQ fan and I didn't expect it would be was sweet as it was.  The coleslaw on the sandwich was crisp and tasty.  The sandwich was very large and served on a good sized bun.  I should have cut it in half at the start so I could take 1/2 home.  I didn't finish my fries which is something I rarely ever do in order to finish the sandwich.  I then delicately dipped my napkin into my unused water glass so I could get the sticky BBQ off my fingers.

We all passed on dessert.  I need to return ands try one of the paninis and get there early enough to try the crab bisque.

I should honestly do a chargeback for those meals as they were okay but not great. The chicken tasted burnt and smelled a bit funny. Taste wise left a lot to be desired. Poki bowl was good overall. Obviously the big issue though is the food poisoning. I can deduce it was here based off the fact I hadn't eaten for about a 10 hour period before hand and drank no alcohol, only water.

Food is so tasty! I ordered #2, pork belly bao, and mother ordered the clam udon bowl. Portions are plenty for its pricing, just sucks we couldn't take our leftovers since we had plans afterwards.

Staff is incredibly sweet and energetic, very welcoming from the moment we entered. Though there is no waiter service, one of the cooks still checked up on our table to see if everything was good. From my observance of about 8 or so small walk-ins that night, staff ran orders out quickly, cashier (young lady) was super sweet & helpful, and customers left happy.

The inside decor is simple, yet so dynamic because of the awesome lamps! Plenty of seating as well. 

One minor issue is the beeping of the buzzers they hand you for your food. If there are a lot of parties, beepings go off when food is ready for pick up. Again, minor issue (plus they had Seinfeld on TV so who cares).

The food was okay it wasn't mindblowingly great by any means.  I was with my SO and it was his and the kiddo's first time having an authentic chinese dinner and they seemed to enjoy the food.

The other one that was in a cabbage leaf was a little over dry and lukewarm.  In total we probably ordered about 10 dishes.  

The service was okay. The were very polite and nice to all of us, but they didn't really refil our drinks as much as I would like, and when we asked for a sprite, it took about an hour and 2 requests to finally get it.  So I would say that it was sub par.

I used to be content eating Cup O Noodles with a cracked egg...don't judge, we've all been slummin' at some point.
A friend of mine recommended Sora and I'm glad to say I can still call her a friend.
First off, I appreciate the quick service and slightly more ample seating. The servers were on their game and quickly delivered the goods with a smile and thorough explanation of the menu. I initially expected to pay a la cart for tamago, chashu and spicy meat like at the other places. But for $8.50 I can get a SPICY MISO RAMEN with all of the above...what a great deal! Of course you can get extra portions of these items for just a $1 or $2...again not a bad deal considering some other ramen houses charge much more.
SPICY MISO RAMEN was perfect! I loved the spicy meat that should be a ramen staple...lean ground meat with a slight sweetness and once mixed into the rich, not too salty miso broth, completes the ramen experience. Chashu is a newly acquired taste for me as I wasn't a fan of fatty pork belly, but in a steamy bowl of ramen is now an unctuous treat I crave. Chashu, slow braised pork belly that takes hours to cook to achieve that tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture. The only thing I didn't like and will probably always have an aversion to is the fermented bamboo shoots..menma. I think it ruins my perfect bowl with its stinky presence...sort of like the uncle no one likes who keeps showing up at dinner. I must remember to omit it from now on.
I enjoyed the simplicity of Sora's ramen that didn't try to pack in everything and give you ramen ADD with adding things like black garlic, chili threads (offenders know who they are). Ramen is a simple bowl of comfort food meant to satisfy and warm the soul. Sora achieves this and is what a good Obaasan (grandma) would approve.",12/6/2014 6:09,36.1260718,-115.1922452,3939 Spring Mountain Rd,NV,Las Vegas,89102,"Restaurants, Nightlife, Bars, Chinese",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Little Macau

I was first introduced to Inglot in July 2014. I was going to get my makeup done for my 25th birthday and my best friend accompanied. My makeup at that time was done by Michelle and my best friend has hers done by Aimee. Michelle, was very sweet and listened to exactly what I wanted and genuinely cared about my happiness for my birthday. Aimee, is a rockstar and so down to earth. My best friend loved the work she did. Aimee, has also done my make up for an audition I had for a feature film and was also kind enough to do another one of my friend's makeup for her birthday. My friend never wears makeup so it was a surprise that I took her there and when she saw how Aimee transformed her, she was nearly in tears but of course, she held them back and did not destroy Aimee's beautiful work. 

On two occasions (a sexy date night and Halloween), I had the pleasure of having my makeup done by Mary. She was so knowledgeable of the products and thoroughly explained everything she was using on my face. Her work had me looking flawless! My date night was definitely memorable and I was an adorable leopard on Halloween. 

I cannot forget Elizabeth. This beauty did amazing work on me for a party and a wedding. She is very honest on what she thinks works or doesn't and is so gorgeous she has already earned your trust with the canvas she displays on her own face. She was very thorough with me when I was buying product and answered all my questions regarding quality and pricing in great detail.


This place is amazing, I do not trust anyone else with my make up needs. The prices for both make overs and product cannot be beat. The product is of great quality and the staff is superb. I will always and forever recommend Inglot to family and friends.

Cocktails were very good but inconsistent. The spicy watermelon cocktail was a little too tangy but still good the first time. I assumed that it was supposed to be that way.

Admittedly a 'standardized' menu featuring solid renditions of the classics but little innovation it would be easy for me to dock points for issues such as tepid duck or small, slightly overcooked shrimp but taking into account the nature of cart service compared to the menu style common to the elite of the SGV or BC nearly every dish we selected was nicely prepared and ample in portion, the total bill for 11 selections ringing in at $45 before tax and tip.  Speaking to specific must orders, particular favorites particularly well done would include both the baked salty egg yolk buns and the even more impressive steamed version of the same, but most of all the golf-ball sized crispy shrimp balls served along semi-sweet Chinese mayo sauce - the rich, supple interior so good a second order for 'dessert' proved mandatory.",12/30/2013 20:48,36.132668,-115.16398,"3025 Las Vegas Blvd S, Ste A",NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Drugstores, Food, Photography Stores & Services, Convenience Stores, Cosmetics & Beauty Supply, Shopping, Beauty & Spas",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,Shopping,,,Restaurants_FoodShopping,Walgreens

The best thing that me and the hubs ordered was the meat and cheese plate. When we try new restaurants we like to try a few different dishes... Here when we ordered thru a few appetizers (mind you they are small) the waiter proceeds to cut me off and say ""you realize your ordering like 5 appetizers"".... I was just kind of thrown off by that response, one order of cheese is like 4 slices and the meat follows the same pattern, followed by a few meatballs so honestly I didnt think it was too much food. Not sure what he was implying when he said that but it is what it is. 

Hefty bill at the end and left with a feeling of ... little satisfaction. I would come back here as I did like their options for meat and cheese platters but theres just way better places out here to eat for the same price.",11/30/2018 6:27,36.1801087,-115.1785503,831 N Rancho Dr,NV,Las Vegas,89106,"Mexican, Restaurants",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Molcasalsa Mexican Food

TPsmYa-FDPjXjymQYXWnvg,Ukftve4xSQvRSZ3auDNSsQ,MCQABzk15LzZ8f-ApWgs5A,1,2,0,0,"I was interested in doing the KOR whitening and I found Dr. Callaway in a listing on the KOR website. When I called to make an appointment, the lady who answered didn't even know what KOR was, insisted it was the regular whitening and I could see any dentist at thier office. This is incorrect. I insisted she speak to Dr. Callaway, in which she eventually confirmed that KOR whitening is only offered by Dr. Callaway. I went to my first appointement to get impressions for the trays and then I was to come back for a second appointment for the in-office whitening procedure. Unfortunately, Dr. Callaway works 2-3 days a week, between the hours of 8 am - 12 pm and goes on vacations frequently, so it is almost impossible to make an appointment with her. Needless to say, I was never able to go in for the whitening procedure that I already paid for because she never had a two hour appointment block available. To be fair, it would have been nearly impossible for me to go during her working hours due to my job. So, I just let it go and would reschedule in the future.

Fast forward two years later. I just finished Invisalign (from another practice) and I need to start from the beginnig with the impressions, as my teeth are now straight. I call the office to make an appt. with Dr. Callaway, in which I explain it's for the KOR whitening and I have to see her. I wait 3 weeks for an appontment just to find out that the front desk lady booked it with another dentist that does not do KOR. I mean really....how much more clear can I be? So, I attempt to reschedule and she says I need to pay for an exam. I explain that I see another denist and just had a cleaning, exam and x-rays done two weeks ago and I would be more than happy to bring my records. She refused and stated that I had to have an exam and x-rays by Dr. Callaway before they would do a consult for KOR whitening. This was not the case when I went previously. 

Bottom line - the office staff is incompetent and this particular dentist is impossible to see. My impression is that they are only after money instead of providing great patient care. Vegas has numerous qualifed dentists to choose from, so I would highly recommend picking another practice.",4/3/2019 3:13,36.1316401,-115.1908263,"3111 S Valley View Blvd, Ste M101",NV,Las Vegas,89104,"Specialty Food, Ethnic Food, Food, Thai, Restaurants",Restaurants,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Little Bangkok Thai Restaurant

walking in its definitely a hipster vibe. it's very nice inside. if you're in college I'd imagine it's a great place to relax, study and get coffee.
I ordered the brekkie burrito and the smashed avocado toast. I also got an iced chocolate mocha. it was very bittersweet which I surprisingly loved. I added vanilla because they said it would make it sweeter-- I strongly discourage doing that. it would have been better without it. but still delicious anyway.
the avocado toast was so good even though it was so simple. it's literally avocado smashed on sour dough rye with a poached egg and some grape tomatoes. not a fan of sourdough bread but it all melted together very nicely.
I got the brekkie burrito which is chorizo (your choice of beef or soy) Chipotle potatoes, refried beans, and some other stuff. it comes with salsa and sour cream. both the toast and burrito came with mini spring greens salads.
I was surprised how filling the avocado toast was. all in all the food was delicious but very pricey. I paid almost $30 for my toast, burrito, and drink.

The staff is knowledgeable and helpful, the prices are reasonable and it truly is available for all sorts of skaters, from ""a level"" hockey players to figure skaters to curlers.
The level of care and attention to the ice is highly commendable. The ice is zambonied after every session and they make sure to keep the north rink a bit colder for hockey. You can't really tell you're skating in the middle of the desert.
If I could improve one thing, I would make a membership program or skate session bundle pack to save frequent skaters and families money. 
Also, I wouldn't be sad if they put down another sheet of ice someday. They host a lot of tournaments and the ice can get a little tied up during those times.

I decided to give Box Bros a full fledged chance being that I had not yet dealt in person with them. I brought my large and valuable item (a 60lbs handmade solid cedar chest with custom art on the lid) to them for crating and shipping, and if all goes well I am apt to give them a full 5 stars. 

After dropping off my item I received a phone call from Chris about my previous review. He was fully apologetic for the previous mix ups, which in retrospect are understandable, and made it worth my while to try their service again - regardless if I changed my review or not. I do have to say that their in store experience was perfectly fine (Zach helped me out in store), and if my items arrive safe and secure they are certainly deserving of a good review. Hoping to have found a trusted place that makes packing/shipping my items truly this easy, as it takes a lot of worry off my mind. 

Will update soon!

----------
4/15/15 - One Star
Unfortunately the cedar chest arrived standing on end (with no markings indicating which side should be up) and upon opening the box the end panel was blown out/broken and the frame in pieces. I'm about as far from happy as it gets. My client has $1000 piece of trash sitting in her living room.   

-------------
05/06/15 - Five Stars

I stopped in to the Dean Martin location to check on my damaged chest as it had been returned to them, and got to talking to Chris about how to get my other chests shipped, as I still had two more chests to ship, and in a hurry. All of the other options to ship were twice the price, and I had already charged my clients shipping based on the estimate I received thru Box Brothers/UPS. 

After evaluating the damaged chest he came up with the idea of removing the lid and packing it separately, making for two more manageable boxes that could fit extra foam and packing. I decided to give them another shot, as the fault really lie with UPS trashing what was already a well packed unit. If they could pack their way around UPS's miscreant ways, it would solve my problem. I realize this could have happened with ANY shipper, but it was unfortunate to have it happen my first time out with such a valuable package. 

So we removed the lids from the bases, and each was rolled in bubblewrap and boxed with foam. It all seemed extra bombproof, and I watched as they packed each one. UPS would literally have to run over the darn things to wreck them.

Fortunately, both chests arrived to their destinations completely intact, and both clients commented on the quality and thoroughness of the packing job. I really appreciate Chris Long and crew going the extra mile to get things done right. 

My only hang up in this whole deal is with UPS. They took a well packed unit with sturdy contents and somehow managed to destroy it. Box Brothers as able to engineer their way around that problem, and went the extra extra mile by not charging me for packing on the those two chests.",4/4/2015 18:13,36.10634,-115.173527,3730 Las Vegas Blvd S,NV,Las Vegas,89158,"Food, Coffee & Tea",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Starbucks

While not quite as good as its sister locations, this is the closest one to me so I eat here often. The signature stellar Lindo service is here (really, how do they always manage to give 5 star service no matter the time of day) and the food is delicious. 

I love the queso here, it's basically a big plate of REAL melty cheese baked with charred poblano peppers and served with Lindo's delicious homemade flour tortillas! I love the tortillas here and I frequently eat my weight in them (bye bye low carb diet). The complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip is always a hit too. The food here is just delicious. You can't go wrong with many of the dishes (although sometimes the chicken quality in some of the specialty dishes is a little bit rubbery and ""off"" -- don't know why, but it has happened a couple of times at this location). I've never had an issue with the chicken quality in the chicken fajitas or with any of the seafood or beef dishes. The guacamole is worth getting, and they have yummy Diet Pepsi and fresh brewed iced tea. Again, the focus is on quality and service. 

The prices are higher than your average Mexican restaurant but I think it's worth it. This location runs incredible lunch deals and specials during the week, and the kitchen is fast so it's the perfect spot for a quick workday lunch. 

The hostesses will automatically try to seat you in the bar section of the restaurant if you are a party of just adults. There's an extra special atmosphere in this area on weeknights when a dude in a sparkly red shirt plays a synthesizer and sings pop songs in broken English. It's pretty rad and it's not too loud, which is nice. If you are looking for a quieter experience, ask to be seated in the other part of the restaurant. 

Note that the parking lot here is deceptive and is often overflowing with cars. Even if it appears packed, do not be discouraged and assume there's a wait -- go in anyway.

The meatballs you gave us in exchange had the same sauce. We paid over 40 dollars to leave hungry. Even my son's spaghetti and meatballs were over cooked.

The place is small, smaller than monta ramen so there's not much space. When 3 of us came, they wanted to sit us at the far end & I saw the space was a little tight so I choose to wait patiently until the other spot became empty. Five minutes later 6 people walked in & this ugly guy behind the counter who makes the ramen tells me we have to sit at the far end where I refused to take earlier because the six people that just came in can sit altogether because the other customers are almost done eating so there will be six chairs perfect for this 6 people who just got there. I said I came first so why do I get thrown to that tight corner I refused to sit in the first place to accommodate this people who just came & I waited to get the spot I wanted!!! So that guy behind the counter who makes ur ramen still insisted that I should give up the spot I waited, for this 6 people that just came! What kind of customer service is that?! If those people wanted to sit together then they can wait too for other customers to be done like I did! You don't treat your customers like that! So then other customers started looking at us because he kept saying I should give up the spot I waited for to the late comers but still I refused. If it wasn't for my 2 sons that took me there i would've walked away that instant! He's very rude! For the taste, I ordered #2 and there's no taste and I think they're expensive for just a ramen. Idk if I was just too upset to enjoy my food because of what happened earlier, it taste bland to me. Monta ramen is cheaper, still tastes better WITH BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE !!! I wasn't gonna leave any tip but it's customer's etiquette to do so, so I did though they have no business etiquette especially who claims to be the owner of the restaurant behind the counter. But i sure did write something on the receipt that I will give review on Yelp for sure! People go places by word of mouth & Yelp reviews. I guess no recommendations for this place for me!

I say ""wtf does that mean?"".  Well, it means that the tire pressure is low.  So we put air in all the tires and it seems that the issue is fixed.

Several hours later, after I've grown tired of the strip we decide to head out and find something more affordable and low key.  We end up at a restaurant that's open 24 hours, excellent!  It's about 11 p.m. now.  As I make a uturn to go into the parking lot something sounds funny, the car won't turn like it should...this just isn't right.

We pull into the lot, I get out and low and behold...my rear tire is flat.  This is my first flat ever.  I can fix a lot of things, but for some reason I was really caught off guard by this.  

So we ate, I pulled out my AAA card, contemplated them.  Then I used the trusty Yelp app on my phone and found this place.  Only a mile away!  Sweet!  And 5 stars?  Even better.  Open 24 hours?  Sold!

We make our way over to this place, pull in and they immediately help us out.  They told me I shouldn't have driven on a flat tire and that we'll probably have to get it replaced...ahhhh!  

At this point I'm assuming they're going to try and make a quick buck on me.  I'm a little stressed out and bummed that some of my fun money is going towards this, but oh well, it needed to be done.

They offer me a used tire at $35 or a new one for $100.  Used please, just as long as it'll get us back to Long Beach in a couple days.  They fix it up, throw on the tire and I go to pay.  The gent at the register asks if I got a new tire or a used one, I tell him used and he gives me my total....$35!!!  Really?  Seriously?  

Yes folks, that's right, these guys were super awesome and fixed my flat tire along with installing a new-ish tire to boot!",9/28/2010 17:57,36.27990729,-115.2071437,6595 N Decatur Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89131,"Restaurants, Burgers, Food, Fast Food, Coffee & Tea",Restaurants,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,McDonald's

I live across from Greens.  I've been there 3 times and each time has been so disappointing,the last time insulting.

The first two times, which were on Saturday's during the day, I had a hell of a time getting a drink, at a bar. I spent $40 playing .$25 video poker and got one drink.  Terrible service.

The last time I will ever visit this place was tonight.  I was ejected on a Saturday night (9/17) at 12:30am because I was whistling to music.  Apparently the unhappy lady sitting 10 feet from me complained to the bartender who asked me to leave because my whistling annoyed this woman.  This is Saturday night with music blasting.  This woman, who must be having an affair, and was rude, convinced this jerk of a bartender to ask me to leave for whistling.i will complain to Stations Casino.  This place needs to be shut down.

15 minutes later...... I realize I left my card and did t get my station credits.  After ringing in, the bartender confronted me and I told him I left my card and didn't get my 3x Station credit.

He gave me my card and told me to leave.  I asked him, ""are you really asking me to leave because i whistle?""  His girl said ""No, I asked him to throw you out because I couldn't stand your whistling"".  At that point, I was escorted out, with no station credit.  I told the bartender I would complain to management, and he laughed saying ""tonight was his last night.  He called me a douche, and slammed the door.  Don't go here!

Went in on a Tuesday night at 6:45pm and seated immediately. The complimentary chips and salsa were brought to the table shortly after. The salsas were so-so. The red salsa was served warmed, and the cilantro creamy salsa was served cold. We asked if they had some other salsa's, which they did. A habanero green salsa, which was pretty spicy with a kick, and another red salsa. These ones had a little more flavor, in my opinion, so definitely ask for those to try them! They were offering happy hour all Tuesday for drinks (margaritas and draft beers). 

On to the food....talk about generous portions! It was so much food for 2 people. My friend got the Shrimp Poblano and I got the Beef fajitas a La Cucos. We ordered flour tortillas, and each got 2 fresh tortillas. Both dishes came with rice, beans, lettuce and guacamole. The beans and rice were flavorful. We both agreed we would order them again. The shrimp poblano wasn't what we were expecting, as the creamy sauce was in the middle and shrimp all around. The shrimp was fresh but a little overcooked (but it was still tasty!) The beef fajitas were O.M.G. good!! Probably some of the best beef fajitas I've ever had. The beef was so tender and yummy! The onions were sauteed to perfection. If you don't eat that much, I'd say an appetizer with a one person fajitas would be plenty for two. Prices were a little on the higher end.

Noticed Lazy Joe's while driving back and forth on Rainbow and also found their ad on a local newspaper. One of my husband's faves is Fish and Chips so this was a place we had to go to...someday.

We finally checked it out for a late lunch on Friday. When we arrived, it was packed! There were no tables available...It's a small place. I would guesstimate the maximum capacity of 30 people. 

Their menu isn't posted anywhere except an 8x11 copy in front of the register. The hostess was quite helpful and made suggestions while we perused through the menu. 

I ordered the Fish Sandwich (Cod) which comes with a side of cole slaw and fries. I also ordered Clam Chowder and a drink. Total price: $13.80. Not cheap!

My husband ordered the 2 Fish Filet which comes with a side of cole slaw, hush puppies and fries, and a drink. His bill was about $12.00.

Their cod Fish Sandwich was very good! Not too greasy. The batter was light. It didn't overpower the fish. They give you a choice between cod, catfish and some other fish. They also give you a choice between regular or seasoned fries. The cole slaw was creamy and a bit underseasoned. The clam chowder was delicious! (Although, they give you a tiny portion for $3.99.)

Luckily the employee counted us off and told us that anyone in the first 18 people (I was #8) would get a car.  After another 45 minutes I got to be second in line (yes, 45 minutes to move 6 spots) a fellow customer told everyone in line that the employee had lied about having 18 cars, and that they had actually run out.  After the employee confirmed this, they told us we could take a cab to the hotel and come back in the morning to pick up the car, at which point they would reimburse the taxi.

When I came back, they only reimbursed me for the ""fare"" portion of the taxi receipt and not the tip, airport fee, or credit card fee.  When asked why they didn't reimburse me, they said these were optional.

Poor customer service made this bad situation worse.  Had they informed us immediately that they did't have enough cars and covered the full cost of the taxi ride, I would have saved 1.5 hours and wouldn't be posting this review.

Issue #1: the technician performed two different pelvic ultrasounds, and I was not informed they were doing two. 

Issue #2: I was told that I could not get my results over the phone, and that I had to make a second appointment. But I was not informed that a $120 fee would be applied. My results were negative/benign, so they can't argue that the results were sensitive or upsetting and required an extra visit in person. 

Issue #3: I called May 8 to set up a monthly payment plan and billing agreed to have the office manager look into the billing. I called again June 8 because I had received no response. Billing apologized and agreed to have the office manager look into the billing. I called again June 18 and was told to call the office manager, Vanessa Washington. I called and was transferred to a voice mail that was full. I called again July 2, was put on hold, and then was sent to Dr. Tabassi's voice mail, not the office manager. I called back (same day) and was sent to voicemail that was full again. Then I was forwarded to make an appointment. I finally gave up and paid the bill July 11.

Arriving around 2030 there was a waiting list for 15 minutes. No problem. We put our name down and (upon suggestion from the hostess) tried to have a drink at the bar. But....the bar was crowd and it seemed not to be possible to get attention to order a drink. Probably we looked a little bit desorientated because one of the waiters asked me whether I was looking for the restrooms. No....looking for a place to wait for our table, preferebly with a drink. He appointed us a table and send a waitress over to take our orders So far, so good.

Ordering dinner also went well. Big selection of beer and (pub)food. But considering it's pubfood, pricy. (Minus one star.) Our party decided to share two appetizers (drumsticks and duck spring rolls) and to go with the hamburgers and a salad as a main course.

First of all: everything arrived at the same time. Hardly fitting the table. Nobody seemed to find that strange. (Minus the second start.) The waiter (very obligatory) asked if everything was good. I answered that we were very dissappointed that every thing was served at the same time. He only nodded and said 'Yeah, that's a bit strange, but I don't know either why THEY did that'. Sorry, I don't like it when staff is blaming each other and is not interested in the guests or in solving the problem. He just walked of. And that was the third star I deducted.

Portion are huge, but I rather have a smaller portion, better prices, a little bit more quality and definetly a much much better staff. More interested in the guests. Both the waiters and the kitchen. There someone could also have noticed that it's strange to serve appetizers and main courses, all hot dishes at the same time. I think the waiter wanted us out in a hurry to get the table free for the next fools. And the big portions only leads to high bills and a lot of waist (think about our planet......).

Drumsticks and springrolls we're good, hamburgers also. The greek salad was very dissappointing. Dry and salt lamb meatballs, too much dressing, too soon poured over the greens so they were weak. I shalln't deducte an extra star for the poor salad because the MGM deserves an extra star because this (although we had a bad experience) is much better than the former fish restaurant that occupied the spot for years.

Update 2016: Things have changed. But nog for the better. Mothersday, 2030, hardly 1/4 off the tables in use. The menu seems to be smaller than before. We both ordered the 1842 Burger after the waiter asked for our choice for the third time in the fitst five minutes. Burger was oké, but expensive ($20). The fries were probably 'gourmet' but not to my liking. A bit sweet. All together: still a 2 star experience. Will not be back.

I was really nervous about putting them in school 6 hours a day after having been a full time stay at home mom. My 4 year old loved it so much I had to beg him for kiss goodbye by the 3rd day. My quiet little 3 year was a bit more gun shy but every day when I pick her up she is bouncing off the walls with excitement about her day. Aside from my children's happiness which is by far the biggest indicator of a good program I have to say that I also love how much the owner and teachers work with me on my kids individual needs. They also really get to know the children's strengths and weaknesses and I feel very supported in my parenting of them. Several times they have helped me better interact with my children in a productive and honoring way and they have reminded me through the way they treat my children just how important and special they are.

niJ7kcKfvmrQGw7YbqWlDg,MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,ZAuAwz1ijuydn5yL3q3rzA,4,1,0,0,"This is a great place for curry. If you are from Hawaii, longing for Curry House, then this is your best bet. They offer an array of meat to accompany your curry, or you can opt for a simple curry sauce and rice. Zen is located in the same complex where Monta Ramen is. If you don't know about Monta...yelp. 

There is a base price of 5.95 and price goes up depending what and how many items you add into your curry. The great thing about this place is that they do have vegeterian selections, and they also offer side dishes/appetizers such as takoyaki, deep fried oysters, shumai, edamame, and much more but my photographic memory failed me.

Today, we ordered 2 of the chicken katsu curry, deep fried shumai, and a spam curry. My son loves spam so of course he had to order it. The spam slices came out really thick, think he only had three slices of it, but again...they were pretty thick of a cut. I shared my katsu plate with my 6 year old so we ordered an extra scoop of rice. I love curry; I just don't enjoy the heavy feeling. Sharing with my son was the perfect portion for both of us. The chicken katsu itself was delightful. It was perfectly crisped, the meat didn't look ""dead"" inside (you know...that dry old chicken look),  and the fact that it isn't seasoned at all or heavily season is also a plus to me, because it'll be chillin on top of curry sauce anyway. As well all know...curry has enough depth, the extra sodium on a breaded chicken would be unnecessary. 1 thing I did wish is that my curry sauce came out a little bit more hot temperature wise. It was more like lukewarm. I'm just one of those people who love seeing steam come from my plate. It's confirmation to me my food is coming out fresh. Hell, it could've been microwaved for all I know if there were steam, but I wouldn't know--I just know I want it to look like it came fresh out the pot.

It was busy when we arrived, but we did not have to wait at all. We came in on a Tuesday afternoon, but twas Veteran's day so perhaps twas the reason for a full house? The facility was very clean. The waitresses were attentive. We did have to ask for our waters to get refilled at the end of our meal, but two refills prior to that they came without question. Tables kinda sit close to each other as the facility isn't big. So no nasty talk unless you want the people next to you joining in. Lol. I don't recommend bringing a stroller in there as well. I didn't have mine, but when I walked in I thought thank goodness I didn't bring it in. Kinda figured considering we are on Spring Mountain and such eateries along it don't offer plenty of stroller room anyway. 

For my family of 6 our bill came out into a whopping 32bucks, that's with tax. Can't say the same for others because I still have kids that are in the sharing zone. Good deal to us. Anyway, before I get 'curried' away....pause....I will certainly be returning whenever we are feeling Zen like.",11/12/2015 0:01,36.055361,-115.251659,7315 W Warm Springs Rd,NV,Las Vegas,89113,"Bars, Sports Bars, Piano Bars, Restaurants, Burgers, Nightlife, Steakhouses",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,"Michael T's Steaks, Ribs, & Burgers"

Eggslut is located inside the Cosmopolitan on the second floor. It's very close to the escalators so you won't miss it! It's more of a fast food type service where you stand in line (usually a long one) order and pay, then wait for your order to be called. I wasn't sure what to order so I went for the basic egg and bacon sandwich! Can't go wrong with bacon! I also got a cup of their iced cold brew! My order came up quickly maybe 10 minutes. My mouth was watering at first sight and my very first bite I was smitten! It was yummy! Some things I would have changed to make it more yummier would be to make the bread a bit crispier, the egg a bit more runny and use less ketchup. Maybe I can customize my sandwich on my next visit.

Frankly you can give this place 4 stars simply for its amazing location right on the strip across from the Bellagio fountains.  The view here is great and the fact they keep even the outdoor area cool with huge blasts of AC is an accomplishment in of itself.

The breakfast chow was pretty decent.  I had a simple ham and cheese omelet and it was good.  A nice side of potatoes helped round out the meal.

The receptionist made me a coffee when I arrived and I was pleasantly surprised when Nick the Master Stylist took me right away even though I had only booked for the less expensive stylist option as I would've had to wait.

Nick was friendly and incredibly knowledgeable. He recommended an awesome new Mitch product (which I love) that works better with my type of hair and requires less than a quarter of my old product to get the same results.

Stayed in a studio with my fiance for 3 memorable September nights and I'll definitely consider staying again on future visits. It starts off quite nicely with a limo picking you up at the airport and a cold bottle of Voss as you make your way to the Monte Carlo (which despite so so reviews was a pleasant surprise in it's own right). We entered the VIP service area and had no problem getting an early check in along with free wine, water, and coffee. The valet (very personable) escorted us and our bags to the 32nd floor. You step off the elevator realize it is going to be a really cool place to be. The suite assistant gets you started with a little Q&A about Hotel32 and what it offers, then if you are like us you gravitate to the private lounge that offers amuse bouche style breakfast and dinner selections along with free water, coffee, and soft drinks. They seemed to be themed from the restaurants within the Monte Carlo and were actually really good. You can also order adult drinks in the lounge which are not free but that's to be expected. One suggestion I would have for the Monte Carlo on that front is have the same free selection of wine they offer down in VIP services within the Hotel32 lounge as well. Another suggestion provide the option of having your fridge stocked in the studio rooms like they do in the upgraded rooms as well as the espresso maker (guess that's why it is called an upgrade). The elevators are a little bit of a bummer as well. The two that have Hotel32 on them give you the perception that they are exclusive but anyone can ride. Hotel32 guests have to enter their key card into a slot that allows them access but any guest or non-guest for that matter can ride up to the top floor if the card has been used. We actually had a confused old drunk ride up and get off on our floor, and not to be snooty but he did not belong. So besides these few annoying items Hotel32 was awesome and if not for the above mentioned blips I would have given 5 stars. I'd also like to say again the Monte Carlo is really not close to as bad as some of the reviews I've read about it. I've never stayed in their regular rooms so that could be the reason, but the hotel/casino itself was clean, had great access/location, and had a good selection of shops and eats (The Pub was great).

I was greeted immediately upon entering which I always appreciate.  The store is on the minimalist side.

The styles I looked at ranged from $85 to about $120, which I think is reasonable for a quality athletic shoe.  It's not the biggest selection since it is strictly New Balance but they have some fun colors and styles.  The sales associate said that even if it is not in stock they can order special sizes and widths so that is a great option.

King bed with a tv and nice view of Rio side. Then a sofa and another tv on the other side of the bedroom. They cleaned the room every morning and replenished new water bottles, fresh towels and new travel sized shower stuff. It was really nice there was no casino, as we don't gamble. If you gamble and want a casino then this place is definitely not a place to stay. It was located kitty corner to the Fashion Show Mall so a really short walk to the strip. The pool, although small, was still really nice with plenty of seats to lounge on. There was also a bar if you wanted to charge drinks to your room.

The price was reasonable, about $13 per person for lunch (one star for this).

The service was not great, but acceptable. Our waitress took her time, but she was managing a large number of tables (another star).

They greet you with mimosas comprised of champagne and orange juice. The orange juice is from a bottle so it didn't taste that great (sorry, no star here).

Food quality not so great overall, oysters on the half shell were dry, but they did have prime rib (this earns another star).

Johnny Smalls take on small plates is creative, but also tasty. We tried a few different things and were pleased with most of the choices.

The menu is small, but when just 2 people are dining, the menu can be overwhelming since you want to try so many things, but probably only have room for 2-3 each. 

We went for: 
Chicken and waffles: fun take on this dish. the syrup covered waffle fries were tasty.
Guacamole: Okay. Probably better over at Pink Taco, but they were out of the Pretzel Dip we originally wanted. 
Chili Dogs: I do not eat a lot of chili or hot dogs, but they were good.
Grilled PB&J: Really good. Definitely need to eat it with the jam. 

The service was pretty good. Worth another trip back next time I am in town.

I went back here in August and tried a few other items:
""The Finger""-the salt & vinegar chicken tenders are a bit salty, but are pretty crispy and tasty
Cheesecake Pops-They sound much tastier than they really are. We were disappointed in these.
Beer & Cheese Dip-We really liked this. All the flavors work pretty well in this dip.

My GPS led us to the back of some hotel, but we kept going to see if it was really in the back.  Then some idiot starts honking at us and yelling.  We just thought he was crazy and kept going.  We soon found out, it was security!!! He was such a mean jerk.  Like we'd know who that ""lunatic"" was.  Good thing he still gave us directions (kind of) to Jockey.  We ended up calling Jockey Club for directions.

My friends and I got the condo with 2 rooms/3 beds, and a couch with a pullout bed.  The place came with a fridge and had 2 bathrooms, along with a huge closet.  There are panels of vertical mirrors in the living room area, which is convenient for girls to get ready to go out.

Cons - Check out on Sundays cannot be extended.  Must by checked out by 11am.  I guess this can be a good thing.  It'll make you leave sooner allowing you to do more things during the day! It was a Pro for us lol
Valet - there was only one person working the valet.  The wait was super long, so long that we ended up cabbing to the places we were going to.  The doors are thin.  You can hear people in the hallways.

I was so disappointed when I got here especially since that is what I was really looking forward to. Since the sushi was a bust I decided to try their poke bowl and got my little one a miso soup (which is out of a machine -_-). The menu was a little confusing and the person who was helping me wasn't very helpful either. I ended up getting their To see Roll bowl and it was nothing to appealing. It actually had a wasabi taste to it and that killed my mood for it completely. I asked the worker is there is any wasabi in the sauces used for this bowl or anything in the bowl that uses wasabi and he said no. So thought that was weird. My kid took one sip of the soup and pushed it away which is rare since she loves miso soup.

All were reasonably competent and provided good service. Dr. Chang's practice stands out, however, as by far the most competent and well managed. My latest reline was truthfully the best experience I've ever had while seated in a dental chair and, unbelievably, the least expensive.   

I first visited Dr. Chang for a denture reline and that procedure resulted in the best initial fit I've ever experienced. If you wear dentures, over time they'll get loose and need to to be relined or replaced.  This is because your mouth's structure changes with time and, if you live long enough, it will become increasingly difficult to obtain satisfactory performance from dentures alone simply due to bone recession.  

While I was at Dr. Chang's office, I noticed an advertisement for what are called mini implants, devices used to stabilize your denture and help keep them performing satisfactorily over time.  This was a product that I'd not seen before but they made lots of sense to me, having spent years of ""inconvenient, uncomfortable, or embarrassing"" moments due to my dentures.  I went home after my reline was accomplished and began some in depth research regarding these ""mini implants"". As a result of the research, I decided to try them.  I went back to Dr. Chang and arranged for the placement of 4 mini implants in my jaw to provide better long lasting performance for my lower denture.  The procedure took about an hour and was performed by Dr. Chang and her staff with the same level of competence and professionalism  that I experienced during my reline procedure. In addition, Dr. Chang personally has made a couple of follow up calls to me just to ensure herself that I am doing well.  As a result of my experiences with this business, I've not only found just a first class dental services provider but I've also found some wonderful and caring new friends.

Upon entering you will be greeted by a beautiful hostess, which sets the tone for the night. Everything they do at N9NE is intended to be beautiful and hip, which, depending on what you like, can also get in the way of the experience. 

Personally, I enjoyed it, the ambiance is almost too 'cool' for me, the fairly loud music makes you feel like it's a club, but it also sets the tone, which beckons you to live it up. The crowd is younger and generally dressed to impress. I will not waste your time, but I did have some celebrity sightings, which tells you the type of place this is. 

Let's get into the important part, food and drink. First, I had a dirty martini up, and it came with 3 blue cheese olives, which for me, distinguishes a place immediately. Not everyone will hand stuff the olives, so big ups to N9NE. 

As an appetizer I tried the gnocchi, which was good but not great, and I also enjoyed the Wedge Salad, which did not disappoint. For my entree I enjoyed the 9oz filet (medium/rare), and it was perfection. As good a piece of meat as I've ever had. Superb! 

The sides are all family style and my group enjoyed the asparagus (good) and the potatoes (good). My server was Heath, who had solid command of the menu and did a very nice job. The table service was on par, my water glass was never empty.

They are located in a shopping mall off of Desert Inn. You'll see them next to a Mexican grocery store and a UPS shipping store. I've driven past them countless times, but never really gave much of a thought to going until yesterday when I was dropping off stuff to ship at the UPS. The lunch specials caught my eye - $6.95! Now that's what I'm talking about.

The dining area is super nice looking, almost *fancy*. Believe me, you will be surprised to walk in here from the outside. There was nice music playing overhead and I was greeted quickly by the two women at the back counter. Although I was interested in their lunch specials, they did not really have what I wanted so I ordered from the normal menu instead (to go).

Panang Curry with Chicken (heat level 4 out of 5) - Pretty good, but the chicken had a bit of an odd texture to me when I got it home and began eating it. The spice was right on par. I definitely got a little sniffy while eating it. I wish there had been a few more vegetables/peppers. Came with a very small container of rice (I usually get more rice at other places, even when I order to go).

Thai Iced Tea - Pretty much Thai iced tea. Although they very nicely put a sleeve around it with a handle so I could carry it out to my car with no problem.

Final thoughts - I'll be back when I'm in the mood for Thai and I don't want to trek across the valley. This is very close to home for me and they are definitely THE cleanest looking Thai establishment I have been in on the East Side. I would also love to dine in to enjoy the ambiance of the dining area.

TV's featuring Korean pop are on pretty much all the time and there is even a computer with free internet access in the back of the restaurant.

We stayed in the tower suites (both the Encore and the Wynn) and have enjoyed our stays.  

The service is great, and, for Vegas, it's kinda nice to feel welcome.  

Restaurants:  The restaurants are pretty good and the buffet is slightly above average.  The blue-collar blood in me likes basic food, but not for the Disneyland prices at Zuzu's deli/cafe.  But, if you wanted to pinch a few bucks to play that extra slot machine, the location of Wynn gives you that freedom to go across the street for some food court action.  Also, it's a great place for the girls to go shop while the boys play that god-forsaken game of craps.

Gaming:  Most of the tables are 25+ at might, but you might find a few tables for 15.  I like the craps tables because of its social atmosphere, plus the guys running the tables are pretty cool.  So if I win a few grand, I leave a nice tip for making my gaming experience fun.  Heck, even if I lose, I'll tip them.  They're good peeps.

Clubs:  XS seems pretty popular amongst the 20 somethings.  

Pool:  great service but go early to get a spot

Gym:  very nice, but there's one lady at the desk who gave me a snippy attitude when I arrived in flip flops.  I just wanted use the yoga ball, and I understand the safety issues, but she didn't have to give me an attitude.  So wear shoes and avoid getting scolded.

Room:  The Tower suites give you access to a separate entrance and check-in desk which makes the wait for your room much more pleasant.  The rooms in the tower suites are also slightly upgraded with a separate living space from the bedroom, although there is no enclosure.  So if you have guests stopping by, and someone is taking a pre-party nap, they are still going to be disturbed.  Turn-down service is a nice touch, and the room has all your expected amenities for a 5 star hotel.  

The only issue I had that did not give this place 5 stars is the staff from gym were not super friendly, and the environmental service ladies (the ones vacuuming the lounge) were really rude when I was waiting for some friends in the bathroom.  I did not expect that- and I doubt that this would be expected behavior at St. Regis.

I got my Son a zastava 999/40 cal for Christmas a few years ago. It wasn't malfunctioning/fail to discharge the brass so the next round would jam. I Took it to a couple of gunsmith and they said they couldn't fix it and neither charged me.. Well in conversation with a friend he suggested I try The Accuracy Gun Shop so I did. Well, my Son is currently an Active Duty Marine n was deployed until This past June. I thought if I got it fixed it would be a surprise gift upon his return to the World/United States. Well anyway about 2 weeks later they gunsmith called and said he fixed the weapon/$75, said he had to machine a part but good to go, this was in November. So my Son come to my home on leave and he was very happy to know someone was able to fix it. We went to the desert and unfortunately it malfunctioned just as it did before I took it in so I got my receipt n the weapon back to Accuracy Gun Shop and spoke to the gunsmith, he remembered me because I told him the 1st time why I was trying to get it fixed and that it was for my Deployed Son/US Marine. After about a month I didn't hear back so I called and left a message for him to call me back but he never did so while I was driving down Boulder Hwy I stopped in and the guy a the counter said it was done so he got it and said it's another $75, I was wondering what was up because it didn't get fixed the 1st time n the exact same problem was happening. The gunsmith came out and said sorry I only guarantee my work 30 days, I reminded him that my Son was deployed and didn't get home until June and that we talked about this the 1st time so  it wasn't fired until my Son got leave n came to see me. He said you know that really doesn't matter you only get 30 days, I said I wish he would've told me the 1st time not to trust his work and go out and fire some rounds. Again I explained my Son was deployed n showed him my Sons deployment orders showing I was being factual and again he said, you know that really doesn't matter.

At first, I was really excited. Solid tap list, check. Free play on all the arcade machines, check. Super nice and fun bartender, check. Menu that is a classic hits list of every delicious bar food you've come across until now, check.

Everything was going great - until we got our food. The artichoke & chicken pizza was spot on, I'll give them that. A nice, thin crust and a lot of cheese and toppings. The wings however seemed to be primarily made with one spice in mind, pepper. They were just absolutely covered in cracked black pepper. They weren't awful tasting, exactly, but...who wants a pepper flavored wing? Not me :/

Things didn't get much better when we got the corn dogs. They are huge, clearly made in house, and the corn bread was delicious. It just wasn't cooked all the way through. So halfway down the dog we encountered some oozy cornbread dough which sort of turned us off to wanting any more.

That being said, the hangover fries were pretty good, if not a little over-seasoned (maybe our bad for doing garlic fries instead of regular). I think if there was a little more attention to detail that the food here could be really solid and as enjoyable as every other aspect of the bar.

This is not the first time we've taken our pup to Lazy Dog, the first time we knew he was matted and needed to be shaved down. This time, we took special care to get the right brushes and brush him out properly. His hair is very dense, yes... but it seem like their only answer to a more difficult grooming task is to say the dog is matted and needs to be shaved. They said it would take 4 days to brush out our dog even though we had just done it in a couple hours the day before (and 2 days before that).

So I agree with Dave S., all we got for our loyalty was attitude and a reluctance to do the job.

The restaurant has a warm, comforting feel to it.  You enter by taking an escalator up a couple floors to the hostess stand, where it looks like you have arrived to a living room complete with ottomans, a very comfortable couch, and a photo booth (you mean you don't have a photo booth in your living room?!).  As soon as you enter the restaurant you are greeted with a smokey aroma from their open-fire oven, which has permeated our clothing for the rest of the evening.

The first time we came here for a friend's birthday celebration; she's Italian and loves Giada's recipes.  We kind of made a big deal of it to them ahead of time  Apparently that worked well enough to get us arguably the best table in the house, a window table overlooking the intersection of Flamingo & Las Vegas Blvd, with a direct view of the Bellagio fountains.  It was mid-summer and for some reason the restaurant was quite cold for our ladies, so we had the restaurant open the window to the warm Las Vegas air, which appeased them.  The great service didn't stop there however, as they brought us out every salad on the menu and only charged us for one of them.  They also brought us out every dessert on the menu as well and again only charged us for one of them.  Between our salads, small bites, entrees and desserts the salads were the most memorable.  Produce was very fresh and never overly complex.

The second time was with another friend who loves Giada's recipes and without us making a big fuss about it to them, were sat at a window table overlooking LV Blvd. (view of Caesar's).  This was recent so I actually remember every dish we had.

Baby Sweet Peppers with goat cheese & olive tapenade had a great texture of creamy goat cheese with the crunch of the peppers, the sweet/tangy combo was a great opener.

Orzo Meatballs with parmesan pomodoro, with this I was expecting a little more orzo (pasta shaped like rice) texture, although it turned out just to be a really good meatball.  

Parmigiano-Reggiano with wild sage honey, Sweet Soppressata with garlic & pepper and Bresaola matched up well, probably my favorite ""dish"" of the night, although a little on the pricey side ($40 total).

Lemon wood roasted chicken & creste de gallo soup was a very simple, flavorful ""chicken noodle soup"".  The flavor of the broth transported me back to my youth, when mom would make it on a cold night (which was fitting, since it was hovering around 30° outside).

Arugula salad with candied lemon, crispy pancetta & parmigiano-reggiano, we had this salad before and it was just as good as the first time.  Even though it's just a few ingredients, all of them have strong flavors.

I ordered the lobster ravioli, with lemon butter emulsion, brussels sprouts & pumkin seed gremolata as my main.  Even though our waiter said this was his favorite pasta dish, I felt the flavor a little lacking in lobster.  Perhaps if they added some lobster sauce in with the lemon butter it would've brought it out a little more.  Pasta was cooked perfectly al dente though.

White Cauliflower soup with pickled cauliflower & white chocolate came out last, as we asked our waiter about it during dinner but opted for the chicken soup instead.  We finished up dinner after they were done seating, and the soup was just going to go to waste, so he brought us out a bowl to taste.  The chocolate went well with the nuttiness of the cauliflower, but wasn't overly sweet.  The small bits of picked cauliflower helped cut through its richness.

This restaurant is great for small or large group special occasions or if it's just you and your significant other.  The service will certainly make you feel like you have been personally invited to eat by Giada herself.",1/8/2017 0:48,36.1022507,-115.1699679,3799 Las Vegas Blvd S,NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Restaurants, Diners",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Mansion Dining Room

However there are other food places steps away outside the theater in the casino. They will allow you to eat outside food in line while waiting for a movie but not past the ticket podium.

First of all don't book the party online. Made the reservation took my credit card number but come to find out 2 weeks later it never saved and they told me that this happens. If they don't charge u deposit immediately it does not save FYI

I booked for the middle option for 24 kids. In the beginning there were 2 Party hosts and the 2nd one left to go home 10 mins after the party started. So this one host might be doing a great job but not enough for the amount of work for the amount of people to serve.
Only one interactive game . And not enough yogurt to go around. They only brought in maybe 8 in the beginning and some kids were upset so I had to ask for more. I brought in few paper plates and cups to go with the theme but they never brought our extras and I was having to go down at the Cafe myself to get more . Drinks needed to be refill and my mom had to go down to the cafe a few times to ask for more.
More adults showed up than anticipated to I felt the food was running low . Asked the chef if I could order more and he told me that because of the add ons I added that morning I got him one hour behind. I was speechless! And upset that I got this response . Wish he could've said it might be a while but we can work on that instead I felt panic that we're gonna run out of food. He came back 20 mins later with a nicer attitude and asked me what I wanted to add 

Over all I was stressed out. 2 hours went by quick . It really could've been great but it just wasn't enough help. The indoor playground was great tho and kids loved it. And food was pretty good. But decorations were all me. They just put it up for you.

Don't ask me why, service was excellent, if a little rushed. We were seated at the table right when you turn the corner to enter the dining room. It was a crummy table and asked to be moved. They moved us without hesitation and the hostess confirmed they get that request a lot. We were moved to a semi circular, table right by the kitchen, which was an awesome table! Service was very attentive, almost too attentive. I had just put the last morsel of my amazing Heirloom tomato salad in my mouth when the server wisked my plate away. It was almost like he was watching me waiting to pounce. My husband and son ordered clams which we small but fresh and enjoyable. They both ordered steak and loaded baked potatoes . My husband said the steak was very good but slightly under seasoned. The potato was massive and I would suggest sharing one. I don't eat meat and I dont order chicken breast when I eat out so I got the Mac and cheese side dish. I had a gourmetgasim like I have never had before. Oh my Gordon! That was one of the best things I have ever eaten. I ummed and yummed all the way through. Fantastic! So despite everything I just said I still only give 4 stars.

I had the Aragosta di Salmone ($27). The description begins, ""Salmon and Lobster pair delectably well"" but the only lobster you get is in the bisque that drowns the entire salmon steak. The bisque was really good, but it was very tomato forward and not very lobster. Plus I really enjoy salmon and i like the fish to speak for itself. I think the dish would have been better off if the bisque were a a mist; not a waterfall. But that's just my personal take on how I like salmon. Doesn't mean the dish was bad. 

My mom had the Pork Loin Chops ($20) and my bf had the Rib Eye ($27). 

They also had Osso Bucco ($37) and Cioppino ($35). 

I'd give this place a higher rating if the prices were slightly lower. After a salad,  three entrees, two glasses of wine, and a desert, our bill was $109 before tip. 

This place is kind of old Vegas. We went on a Wednesday night and there was a female lounge singer singing old Billie Holiday jams and such on a small stage in the corner. She had a great voice, but the setting was kind of inappropriate. I think if you're to have live entertainment in a low key restaurant, there should be more upholstery everywhere to dither out the sound. Otherwise, the sound is too direct. 

The singer was a sweet heart, though. She interacted with the audience and half the crowd there seemed like locals. 

They also had a free raffle for a gift certificate for Onyx. It's a nice gesture, but kind of corny for a place that serves salmon for $27. 

I thought the color palette of the decor was kind of schitzophrenic, too. 

The ladies bathroom was huge, though. For a space you could fit two stalls and a sink in, it was a private bathroom. One john, one sink, and a chill out seat, all to yourself. 

There's about twelve tables and booths and a bar. It's a pretty small space, but seems large because it's a perfect rectangle, unbroken up. There's also a bar that seats about eight. The place was at about 40% capacity when we went. Pretty good for a wine and dine joint on a Wednesday night. 

Our server was immensely patient, professional, and gracious. 

My assessment in a nutshell is that I would go back if I didn't have to pay for it. The food was good, but beyond what I'd like to pay for that ambiance and meal.

Food: so clean! Some Phos that I've had leave a nasty feeling afterwards so I stay away from drinking the soup. But the broth here is perfect. I ordered the beef broth seafood pho, it had a lot of seafood in it as well :)

This part of Las Vegas is called Summerlin and has the most expensive real estate in Vegas outside the Strip.  Around here, you will find a ton of nice, high end, restaurants and shopping.  It also appears incredibly safe, without the homeless and derelicts that litter the streets around Bellagio, Caesars, MGM Grand, City Center, etc.

The casino gambling is good here, with $5 blackjack readily available.  I only played craps this trip.  $5 minimum.  The cocktail waitresses also bring free cocktails, beer, and wine like they can't get rid of it fast enough.  This includes premium brands like Grey Goose and Patron.

The room I stayed in was clean, modern, and spacious for only $80/night Monday - Wednesday.  

But the entire property was extremely smokey and burned my skin and nostrils everywhere except in my room and the outdoor parking lot.  You will not find any of that flashy pretentious stuff here either.  Almost everyone looked like they rolled out of bed and did not care how they looked (I strangely kinda liked that).  Worst part about this place is it's a 20 minute drive to the Strip, but I guess that is what some people are looking for.  

Maybe the best word to describe this place is ""COMFORTABLE"" (except for the smoke).  I can see why a lot of people love this place and would justifiably give it a high rating.  But because of my personal preference in Las Vegas for flash, glitz, glamour, action, and superficially beautiful people in abundance, I can only give this place 2 stars.",12/10/2014 19:47,36.1265084,-115.2182851,"5600 Spring Mountain Rd, Ste A",NV,Las Vegas,89146,"Restaurants, Thai",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Marnee Thai Restaurant

When I walked in, I immediately liked the look of the inside with the menu and the pamphlets, cute names of products, and helpful tips with juicing. The owners were very helpful and Marcella explained to me all about their juices, how they are made, and the benefits. I appreciated the taste test area because of course we all want to know what we are going to get.  I was interested in a 3 day juice cleanse but seeing that I have never juiced an entire day, I was not sure how I would respond or if I could handle it. I ended up only doing one day. 

The Magnificent- filtered water, raw cashew, agave, vanilla bean, and cinnamon. 
perfect at night time when you have been juicing all day. It felt like a treat and I don't know what it was but I was unable to finish it. I'm not sure if it was the juice overload or what did it. 

I also liked the Energized, the Love, and the one with cayenne pepper. I like the glass bottle packaging but can I say it does not do well with drinking straight out of the bottle, lots of spills. Maybe you are expected to pour it or use a straw. The small plastic bottles are much easier to drink right out of. 

I would like to try the juice cleanse again but probably when I don't have to work and can stay home. I appreciate the $1 off for bringing back the bottles. I wish they had some sort of loyalty card or system though because the cost is pretty high for me. 

I know Marcella mentioned the juices have a 4 day shelf life but I wonder if the date on top was the expiration date or the date made. My juices had different dates on top.

The distinguished menu is posted on the website and must be printed prior to your arrival. It is only $50/person! It includes your choice of starter. We had the wedge salad and lobster bisque- ahhhhhmazing! Next is your entree, we both chose the 8oz filet which was unbelievable and I really couldn't choose words to explain how wonderful they really were. The meal comes with your choice of sides. Be sure to choose 2 different sides as they are more than enough to share. We chose the au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach. Delicious! After all this, yes, you get dessert included in the special! I had creme brûlée and my husband had the croissant bread pudding. Again, ahhhhhmazing!

Choice of Appetizer
Small Sake, House wine or Soft Drink
Soup and Salad
Hibachi Shrimp
Mushrooms, Onions, Zucchini,
Bean Sprouts and Fried rice
Entrees:
Filet Mignon, Chicken and Lobster

We started with some wine. 
Then a vegetable and shrimp tempura - delicious!

Then Joshua our hibachi chef came out and began his magic. He welcomed us and made a huge poof of flames on the grill. Then he cracked some eggs to make the rice... I actually got a picture of his flying egg and will post it later.  Then he added the eggs to the house sweet rice. Delicious and even though I watched him make it..

The entire staff is friendly and cheerful, no matter what time of day or how busy the season may be. I purchased a boutonnière for my boyfriend for prom in April. I believe that it was only about $15 with tax and everything. I picked it up the morning of the event (4/18), and he wore it from about 2:30 pm until past midnight when he got home. The flower looked just as crisp and beautiful that late as it did when our night began. In late June, he took a Tupperware container out from his refrigerator with the boutonnière in it. It wilted slightly, but I was AMAZED that it still was in such great condition almost 3 months later.

Sunday brunch was great. The Feast Buffets are always clean. Our server was also fantastic. The reason this is 4 stars is because our service was great, the price was right, and we even had a special buy one get one free pass. 

They have their usual international selections. I always try to taste something from every section. And I have to say, there wasn't anything that I didn't really like. I was surprised to see lettuce wraps as an item in the Asian section. That was good. And I know fried chicken is just fried chicken, but theirs was good. They have a hamburger bar where they cook it for you fresh and you build your own burger. That was good too, the meat was good. The dessert station has a gelato bar.

I have never found a restaurant that I loved and hated so much at the same time.  This is an example of a Las Vegas vanity restaurant with an 'experience' I would avoid at all costs but food that begs me to come back for more.

We were seated inside of the restaurant late in the evening, exactly at the time we reserved our table.  The staff were friendly, attentive and professional.  The service staff had spot on recommendations for drinks and appetizers. Stars all around for everyone.

Inside the restaurant was clouded with vanity pictures of chef Martorano in poses that show him as the 'Boss' he apparently is.  Music from the 90s was being pumped through speakers so loud the servers had to shout the specials and signature drinks, and even that was not good enough to hear anything they said. 

Much worse, a string of scenes from Martorano's favorite films were loudly played on TV screens throughout.  Scarface, Rocky 3 & 4, and an old Steve Martin film were forced down our throats as we tried to enjoy delicious cocktails.  Why the TV's?  I felt like we were at home watching bad cable.

The food, however, oh the food!  Are you kidding me?  We ordered four items from the regular menu and specials, and everything was just amazing.  Super fresh, top of the line meat, seafood and pasta.  The standout was a sea bass special, absolutely melt in your mouth perfection.  The pasta was perfectly prepared, just as promised on the menu.

Martorano's is loud, loud, loud, so go for great dining with somebody you don't want to talk with.",5/30/2016 5:15,36.1718195,-115.1423178,"201 N 3rd St, Ste 120",NV,Las Vegas,89101,"American (New), Seafood, Steakhouses, Restaurants",Restaurants,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Triple George Grill

A+ for FOOD.
4,5 stars for the rating but I'm rounding up because I feel like it, and because I can.

The Risotto..... oh, that damned Risotto, I can't stop thinking about that Risotto.  Bursts of flavor... mushrooms, saffron. whatever -  a perfect risotto, I think could eat pots full of this stuff for years.
We also had a sea bass dish - - flavorful, and cooked perfectly -  tender and absolutely fresh.  Yum.

Their fresh mozzarella and tomato was .... well, it was good, but keep in mind that the tomato is baked, and the mozzarella is melted on, unlike the regular fresh mozzie you'd expect.  I prefer it the other way, but it tasted good nonetheless.

We sat out on the patio, eating under the pseudo-but-wonderfully-bright Venice skies, surrounded by gorgeous architecture and statues, not to mention the Italian melodies that floated through the air, assisted by the great acoustics at the Venetian Grand Canal area.... 
We were on a major timecrunch as we had to leave for the airport in 45 minutes.  This was to be the last meal during this particular Vegas trip.  We were assured we'd leave in time, we sat down to order, and our server was attentive enough to be good, but also left us alone to eat.  The food came out quickly, though I am not sure if this is because we made it clear were in a rush, and it was served percfectly.

We even had time left for coffee, but as is the case in the whole damned hotel - - the coffee leaves much to be desired.  Blech.  I swear, I say it again and again, that is the only bad thing about the Venetian.  BLECHY COFFEE.

We were surrounded by people on dates, early dinner meetings, as well as families with many, many children.  Canaletto's is one of those places that is appropriate for any age group, for any purpose, however formal or casual.

Oh, and the bread... with great olive oil.... ahh.

Yes, my boyfriend actually said that. About a show that features a wizard. Honestly, though, we loved this show. We managed to get buy one get one tickets via MyVegas so it only cost $73.88 for the both of us after fees. Redemption was mostly painless, we had to grab the Mresort rewards card, or whatever it's called, and pick up our tickets by 4:00. Going into the theater, we had to of course buy a light up viking helmet for $12. Dinner and pepsi products (sad face) were included. 

Dinner consisted of an average tasting Cornish hen (not too dry, but not that tender either), a nicely seasoned and fresh piece of broccoli, two new potatoes, and surprisingly tasty biscuit. 

As a starter, we received a bowl of tomato soup, which was served from a water pitcher. I imagine that's the easiest way. The soup was really good. We also received a strawberry filled tart at the end. Also really tasty. The service was really friendly, and checked on us several times during the show. 

So dinner was definitely filling, and satisfying, but not particularly amazing. Note: No utensils are provided. I didn't see this in the other reviews. Food is all easily eaten with the fingers, and wet napkins are provided for cleanup. 

The show itself was good, mostly not dirty fun, with fireworks, singing dancing, and of course jousting. The combat was fun to watch. Since seating was stadiumish style around the theater, there was truly no bad seat in the house. 

The only real negative I have about the theater is the seating. The chairs are extremely low to the ground, even for this 5 foot tall girl. Oh, and they are as hard as ROCKS.

This 24-hour unit just opened at Arroyo Grande & Warm Springs, in the old Chilly Palmers space, just across the street from the (now NOT 24-hour) Walgreens. (Hey, I thought this was a 24-town, what gives Vegas?) 

The food was prompt and excellent and reasonably priced; I had the massively-generous portion of chicken-fried steak, with side and salad, for ten bucks. But of course Village Pub and the Ellis family is already well-established in terms of their high-quality, reasonably-priced grub. 

The service was fawning. The bartender convo was excellent. The atmosphere was sedate; it would be especially appealing to those wanting a quiet, upscale space for their video gaming and drinking. There is a separate seating area for those who are strictly diners. 

I hope they deal out a great deal of pain to the nearby PT's Gold unit that dishes out slow service, mediocre food and high prices. 

Btw, NO dart-boards, pool-tables, shuffleboard, video golf, dancing or nightlife. That was Chilly Palmers; this is Village Pub.

in return i was given a contract, but i cancelled it literally minutes after receiving this kind gesture. i didnt need it as much as this kind person thought.

I've been to Pure two other times...let me re-phrase that, I've stood outside of Pure two other times. Both times, all I've witnessed was a large crowd of people. No sectioned off lines, just large masses of people. Okay, well the last time I came to this club was in 2006, so obviously nothing has changed.

Anyways, back to present day. There were 8 in our group. We waited about 45 minutes. 5 people from our group got impatient and decided to leave and walk the strip. As soon as they walked away, the three of us remaining got in. Okay, so we had to wait another 10 minutes while people whined and complained about how much cover was. But all three of us were comped, so I didn't complain.

We got inside and the first thing we did was head to the bar. One kamikaze shot and one long island, $24. I should have just gotten two long islands since they were only $3 more expensive than the shot.

I understand that it's one of the busiest weekends of the year in Vegas. I understand that it's going to be crowded. We made the best of the evening, even met a couple nice girls who were trying to avoid the creepers just as much as we were. Apple from the Black Eyed Peas was spinning, so that was pretty legit. 

Since I didn't have to pay...I gave it another star than I would have. I probably would have been pissed off if I had to pay to get into this place. You can tell it's an older club...they don't enforce dress code as strictly as some of the newer clubs. There were a lot of dudes up in there. 

And it still amazes me that they don't rope off sections so that people stand in a ""line"". It would drive me crazy to just have a crowd of people standing around with no rhyme or reason, if I had to work there. They've been doing the same thing forever now, I just don't understand why they wouldn't make it more organized...it would probably make all of the bouncers/vip hosts/cashiers lives much easier. But whatever, they must have reasoning for it.

The foie gras and steak were delicious but what killed our experience was the glass door! It kept opening on it's own from the wind or the waiters opening them up. We probably exchanged eye rolls and looks with everyone on that side of the restaurant that night!

When I think of cirque shows, I think of creative acrobatic acts. Performers flying through the air, or performing difficult maneuvers. I also picture an elaborate set (stage). 

Zumanity did have some acrobatics, though it wasn't extensive like in other cirque shows I have seen. I didn't do my homework on this show, so I didn't realize it was a show sexual in nature with nudity (mostly topless women).

Personally, I wasn't bothered by the sexual nature of the show or nudity, but be warned, it is quite out there so you definitely have to be open minded. I wouldn't recommend seeing this show with your family, take a date or partner instead. 

What I did like was the wide spectrum of performers. There was representation of many colors. The performances were diverse, touching on many different areas. The show was also LGBTQ friendly. 

There were no bad seats on the main floor where we sat. Be warned that the closer you get to the stage, the more likely you are to be called out during the performance. The show had quite a bit of audience participation. This started at the pre show and continued on to the end. This included people being invited up on stage a number of different times.

When we got to the resort, they told us they did not have any 2BR units but could provide us with a temporary 1BR with a pullout and if a 2BR became available they would be able to move us into that.

The next day, we checked with the reservation desk to see if any 2 BRs were available and MIRACULOUSLY they had a 2BR unit, but we'd have to PAY an additional $130 for it because they had already released the 1BR to us the day before. How convenient. 

So if you're considering this facility or any other in the Las Vegas area, be wary of this tactic.  An Interval member is entitled to a like for like exchange without any additional fees.

Aside from this shady tactic, the units are pretty dated and the bathroom fixtures are absolutely filthy! They look like they haven't been cleaned since the place was built. The kitchen lacks the standard equipment - we actually had to call and request a fry pan! There was a short in the MB ceiling fan which constantly tripped the breaker. And there were NO charging stations on any of the bedroom lamps or anywhere in the unit, including the wall plugs.

Like the rating says - 1 star and buyer beware.",5/17/2017 12:10,36.06256,-115.243388,"6965 S Rainbow Blvd, Ste 104",NV,Las Vegas,89118,"Sandwiches, Restaurants",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Capriotti's Sandwich Shop

I was here for the opening which made me really like this place in the first place. Today, February 11, I came here for 3rd day in a row from how much I really liked this place. I was very disappointed for my visit.

I came here with 2 of my friends today and there was no wait. We were just able to sit immediately. However, upon being sat, my friends and I waited awhile to even be greeted. The table who was sat after us got their banchan, water and sauces before we were even able to. It took about 10 minutes for the server to even come to our table, not even order yet. Finally, we were greeted and the guy took our order which was okay at first since we were understanding that it was busy, but then it was very unfortunate to see that the table who came after us was getting food already.

Later our first round of food finally came in. We didn't even have drinks or sauces. The servers would pass by us like we are invisible was is absolutely ridiculous since we are right in front of the counter. We had to ask for the water and the sauces. We got everything we needed so we were like, okay cool. We were good at that moment.

For the second round of meats, we ordered when we had no food even left. 20 minutes past and there was still nothing that came to our table. A few servers came to check up on us and we stated we were waiting for our order. Then, after the 4th server came up to us, he told us he would check on our order. He came back and told us it seemed like the kitchen didn't get it. So we had to reorder our food again. 

After the next 10 minutes, our food finally came. But not even all of it. Partial of the food came, like 3 times and they were even bringing us some wrong items we didn't even order. Another 20 minutes, after second order, still didn't receive 4 of the times. We were there literally with no food, waiting for someone to even come by to check up on us.

A server came up and ask if we wanted to order more. We told them we were still waiting for these items. He said he would go and check. Never came back. Second server came up and asked us the same thing. He said he was going to check also. A minute later, he asked, sorry what was that again?

Literally had to order our order 5 times.
We got here a little before 5 40pm and yet we are leaving here about 8 40pm after waiting for our orders so long.

4 tables who got here after us even finished before we even did. Keep in mind, we were only 3 people while the other tables was 2-3 people as well.

I really liked this place, reason why I'm coming here for the 3rd day in a row and bringing all my friends and family here. I'm so disappointed with the lack of customer service they provided tonight and it makes me wonder if I even want to come back.

 I have never received such horrible service from any casino. I sat down at a table and gave the dealer my TR card, i am a platinum member, along with my hundred dollar buy in. Nobody ever came to check me in! It wasn't until I was done playing that I had to stop one of the pit bosses and ask to be checked in. He looked at my card, gave it back to me, and said ""yeah we will get ya"" and walked off! 

The dealer was so bad at dealing I think she should have stayed a stripper! I was pretty tipsy, but I had to tell her every time I won! Not some of the times, EVERY TIME!! She would pick up my chips and I would have to say, wait! I won that hand. So I guess you not only lose money gambling but you also have to work for them training their dealers. I have had dealers make mistakes, but she was taking it to a whole new level. The worst part about it is that she started being rude to me! Rolling her eyes when I would call her out, and at one point she started making fun of me because I was losing! 

I then walked over to one of the head pit bosses to express my frustration. She said ""what do you want me to do about it"" and started laughing at me along with a few guys at a near by table. I was furious by this time, and went down to the front desk to speak to the hotel manager. I left two messages, and maybe she is still assisting other guests because I have yet to talk to anyone. 

If I wanted to be ridiculed I could find cheaper ways of doing it, this place is the worst!",8/22/2011 20:18,36.035352,-115.048153,125 Stephanie Street,NV,Henderson,89074,"Coffee & Tea, Food",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Starbucks

Started with a long legged young lady taking us up a winding staircase to our table.( our husbands thought that was a great way to start a meal)
Thomas,  started us out with a nice Malbec, very knowledgeable wine steward. 
We ordered the shellfish platter which was served on an impressive pewter octopus topped with an ice sculpture overflowing with prawns, oysters, lobster, clams, crab...
Ideal way to begin our dinner...
Stephen, the wait assistant, brought out an assortment of breads.  All good but one was so scrumptious, the stilton blue cheese and walnut, I wanted to take home a loaf in my purse.... He was also so conscientious about the cleanliness of our table.
Chris, our above and beyond waiter, brought out the selection of steaks on a tiered display that looked like it was made for jewelry!  Two of us chose the Kobe Rib Cap since we have never had this steak.  I can't find and adjective to describe how delectable that steak was....  We ordered a few sides, mac and cheese, Brussels sprouts, and mushrooms, all perfect but the end to a perfect meal of course was the dessert.
Sticky Toffee Pudding with Brown Butter ice cream.  
We talked about this restaurant the next day, and on the way home on the plane.

 - ample wine selection (and a nicely laid-out, if not obligatory, tasting room)
 - simple, elegant menu
 - consistent food quality
 - casual, but attentive, service
 - a kitchen of culinary artisans

While reserving a table for early dining at Envy, we were certain we wanted three things - a leisurely meal, the chance to try new wines, and delicious comestibles.  Fortunately, we got what we wanted.

As others have noted, the truffle fries are amazing to share, and the portion really is as huge as they say. The four-cheese mac is surprisingly mild, but also a cacophony of flavor hints. Between us we shared the sea bass and a tightly-trimmed New York steak. The asparagus was perfectly steamed, the steak was properly grilled to medium (yum), and the panko-encrusted sea bass was only lightly dusted, ensuring the fresh filet was rightfully highlighted. Only request: More shiitake mushrooms!

Pacing was perfect, and the amuse-bouche of garlic shrimp was a pleasant filler during our course prep. We opted for a couple of ONEHOPE wines - a cab and a zin - both contribute 1/2 their profits to a worthy cause.  Made drinking feel charitable! Honorable mention: The bread basket of freshly-baked rolls. You can just tell these were lovingly crafted. For dessert, their (also freshly-baked) bread pudding was a moist, fluffy delight of flavors to offset a cold night. 

George (F&B manager) made sure to check in with us to ensure the service provided by the energetic Christian was to our liking, and the food the kitchen prepared met our expectations.  Everyone in FOH/BOH worked well together, and the food was easily on-par with Vegas' upper-tier steakhouses.

Is it even possible to transcend?

Maybe we should embrace the now. Maybe it's time to stop longing for Summer, 2008 and seize the day in Las Vegas. Sure, the pizza is almost nothing like Chicago's Pizzaria Uno or Giordanos, but maybe that's the way life is meant to be, and the pleasures of Chicago are, like all things, ephemeral.

The best things here is the prime rib, truffle mac and cheese and macaroons.  The crab legs (dinner only) are the same as planet Hollywood's with claws included. The salads were delicious and they had a respectable selection of salmon and sole fillet, cooked mussels and clams. Meats included delicious sausage, a carving station with stuffed lamb, prime rib, roasted turkey and roast beef, a tray of trip tips. There were repeated stations of clams. The scalloped potatoes are back instead of the mashed potatoes former reviewers have complained about.  I loved the sweet potatoes too! The crepe station is far better than planet Hollywood's remade stack - fresh and made in front of you. 

Avoid the sushi at all costs.  Why there is an Asian section in a parisian buffet is beyond me. The cheese selection as people have mentioned is anemic.

But the truffle mac and cheese! Oh they were the highlight for me and the macaroons have a place amongst the best I've had - including lauderee. The delicate cookie crust has the perfect crunch and the chocolate filling is airy albeit a little too much and i had to scrap some off. The creme brulee is solid.  Skip the tiramisu.

The decor is reminiscent of beauty and the beast very cute and Disney like with the street lights adding to the charm.

They were serving these appetizers called Arancini Tartufo also known as a mouthful of heaven! Basically, they are risotto and cheese formed into balls, fried and served with a cheese dipping sauce.  Each person dining should have their own serving. That same night I ordered their Italian meas and cheese tray with olives and pepperoncinis. To die for! I wanted to go back but the opportunity never presented itself until months later when I received an email that Ferraro's was offering summer deals for locals. So I took them up on their $9.95 lunch special which included a salad and entree. I chose the house salad that was sprinkled with their house balsamic vinaigrette which was sweet and tangy at the same time and the Pollo Vesuvio with Rosemary Sauce. If I wasn't in a high class restaurant, I would have licked my plate. I instead opted for the olive rolls that were served with olive oil and herb dipping sauce to capture the remaining rosemary sauce on my plate. I was too full to partake of dessert. But I have a plan- upon my return, I will the skip lunch special and just do the same appetizer and then dessert. This place is so fantastic! You can tell it is run by a family who puts their heart and soul into every dish!. If you haven't tried it, what are you waiting on?

Not really.
First of all, good luck trying to find a listing of the hours this Thrifty is open: It's not listed on any Thrifty website. On Expedia.com, it is listed as being open to 1:00 a.m.
So imagine my surprise when I approached the counter around Midnight only to be told by a brusque woman at the Thrifty counter that I would have to wait over at the Dollar counter.
Sigh.
When I went to the Dollar counter, there was NO line for Blue Chip members. Fortunately, when I reached the front, the guy had all the information, and kindly handed me my contract and I was out the door. Points to the guys working at the Dollar counter.
But in general...

Membership - if you are a local a membership is recommendable. It's a good place to visit on weekends where you don't have anything planned but still want to do something with the kids or family for an hour or two.

Displays and activities - there's tons to do. Different themes on every level, from water play to science to health education etc... There's also a designated section where they change the display periodically. They once had Thomas the Train which we loved. At our recent visit they have Clifford the BIG red Dog. There's also a toddler section.

Age Suitability - toddlers to 10... Or probably up to 12. My preteen still enjoys playing at the pirate ship, water play area and that middle section where kids can go up and down while exploring the exhibits (it's my least loved section only becoz my aging body couldn't keep up hahaha). My little one loves almost all of the areas and exhibits.

Rest area and Food/snacks - foe the most part there's lots of sitting areas for parents as they watch over their kids explore. The only thing I wish they have ia a snack/food place. They do have a separate eating area but there's not food for sale other than what's on the vending machine. Would be nice to grab a quick bite rest a bit and go back in again for more fun exploration.

Staff - there's ample of staff everywhere.. And EVERYONE i say EVERYONE is very friendly. I know they are required to since they will be dealing with kids. Still I appreciate the effort because no job is easy and I applaud this place and its amazing staff

Cleanliness - entire area and restrooms are well maintained. Of Course some displays can get icky. But that's expected when hundreds of little hands touches them everyday lol

It took us a while to figure out a good place to eat breakfast at since we decided to walk along the Strip to hunt down a Fat Tuesday. But we ended up back at my brother's hotel to try their in house restaurant.

We took a set of escalators up to the second floor to get to the restaurant. It was fairly packed and they had told us that it would take about 45 minutes to be seated. They didn't have beepers to let you know when to come back, but we decided to just stick around the a lot machines downstairs and walk around outside before coming back up to wait there for 10 minutes. Seating was scarce to find when waiting, so we hung out by the wall near the elevator where there were plaques of menus with signatures and pictures with the corresponding star.

We finally were seated and I settled for their signature chicken and waffles while the boys decided to get the spicy hamburger. Between the three of us, these two dishes were definitely enough and over. They serve such big portions that I couldn't imagine trying to finish a dish by myself.

I really love the touch of rosemary on the chicken and how light and fluffy the waffles were, which had sticks of bacon inside. The hamburger was really juicy and the fries that came with it were bomb. We ended up having leftover chicken and waffles that my brother willingly took for a snack opportunity later on.

The team was super excited for my choice.. 

I ordered the ""super sampler""!

The ribs were my favorite. Tender, smoky, and the BBQ rub has just the right amount of flavor.

The pulled pork with the sweet bread is a great combo.

Spicy sausage has just the right amount of heat.

The sides were good, especially that potato salad with bacon! Wow!

My ribeye, while cooked inside correctly, was WAY too charred on the outside. That awful charcoal flavor was also on the grilled veggies. The gnocchi was HEINOUS. Bacon was overused and not very high quality. We hated the creamed spinach. Frankly, of all that we ordered, the only thing I ate almost completely was the baked potato, in spite of the fact that it had gobs of crappy/cheap? bacon on it. Chalk it up to extreme hunger. Gotta say, I was totally surprised at this abysmal dining experience.

Thinking the lack of enthusiasm/appetite that night could be the excitement of travel, etc., we had them wrap up the vast amount of food left because our room had a fridge. BIG MISTAKE.

Our server took a while to come by, she might have been on break or something. By the time she came, we had already looked over the menu and knew what we wanted to order. Our food came out quickly after we placed our order.

Lobster and shrimp quesadilla: unfortunately it was our least favorite dish. I didn't get to taste much lobster and I felt it was lacking some flavor or spice.

Coconut shrimp: their most popular appetizer but it wasn't crispy enough for me. It was pretty good but I was hoping for a stronger coconut flavor. My sister loved this dish. 

Seared ahi tuna: 5/5!!! I could eat an entire plate (or 2) but unfortunately I had to share. The ahi tuna tasted fresh and the salad went very well with it. The mango glaze wasn't over powering either. 

Habanero chicken wings: we probably should have ordered the Jamaican jerk wings. While the portion was really big, we did not enjoy the wings. It was spicy but the BBQ and habanero didn't mix very well IMO.

I, along with the rest of my party, arrived at 6:30 pm only to find a very rude ""Betsy"" with a sharp tongue and attitude taller than the North tower curtly ask me if I wanted the rooms or not after she explained we'd only get King rooms, different floors, and one room would have to be a smokers room. I asked for a manager, she said no one was there (c'mon, it's a casino!). I asked for a manager to contact me - no one ever did. On our way to search for the ""North Tower"", my mother asked a floorperson for directions and was rudely told to look up and follow the signs. Yes, it was Mothers Day weekend and no, it wasn't all that busy. Their parking garage was consistently half empty. In the room, the coffee maker had stale and mildewed coffee grounds in it, the shower wouldn't turn off all the way, and the hallway reeked of marijuana at night. The only positive was the housekeeper when she asked to come in and check in via our phone. Wall plugs were scarce so have fun plugging in your devices. Even the alarm clock was on the other side of the room and not on the table between the beds. Yes, we finally got Two beds but it was at the sacrifice of this disgusting room and hotel.

An artsy, but low key vibe sets the mood. Really, really nice people behind the counter. Healthy food options. Plenty of seating. Clean bathrooms.

I realized that this particular AutoNation dealership has an accelerated maintenance schedule for leases. This is obviously to increase profit and over-maintain a vehicle that could be returned to the dealership when the lease ends. I literally witnessed the Service Advisor change an itemized amount from $70 to $179. I called it out and he gave me 10% off. I believe spending over $600 in the first half of the lease is outrageous. I'm very hesitant to do further business with this dealership, as I do not trust them now. 

My experience with AutoNation BMW was vastly different. No maintenance cost for the duration of the lease and the lease payments were the same. 

The Service Advisor I worked with is top notch and I do not blame him for any of this.

Went to another appliance store and ordered the same exact range and range hood. They are being delivered and installed within a week. Seems like there might be an issue with Monark financially. It does make sense because their parent company is in the news recently for their own financial troubles (Sears). 

Long story short, they need to be honest and transparent with customers and that is why they are receiving a one star review. I have wasted over a month waiting for this because I was told that is how long Wolf takes to ship out. However, when I go to a different store I can get it within a week. Seems a little ""fishy"" to me. 

I am sure they are going to respond with an excuse or explanation but feel free to do a little research about Monark ""Premium"" Appliance's parent company.

I've been to many fancy restaurants before, but with the price I had to pay here (more than $150 per person), I would rather have my dining experience somewhere else. The 4 dish tasting menu consisted of a scrumptious seafood platter (fried banana shrimp, seared scallops, crab claw), aioli cheese ravioli sprinkled with truffles, the main course (roasted buffalo and lamb rib mixed with assorted vegetables, and a copious dessert platter.

Everything was delicious except for the main course, which nobody on our table finished. I usually clean my entire plate when I eat at fancy restaurants serving tasting menus,  but this was the first time I wasn't able to (and not because I was full....) The combination of buffalo and lamb is just too extreme since both are tough (wild) meats. Also, the lamb was just too stanky. That's a -1 star.

I also have to comment that the dishes lacked consistency more than a few times since everyone on our table seemed to be missing something that someone else had. That was a definite -1 star.

I really enjoy the service that they provide and the unique dining experience it affords.  Before deciding to eat here, understand that you are going to spend at least $35/dish.  All of the dishes are family-style, meaning that the portions are large.  If you're curious what that mean like I was before eating here, you should know that a single item can feed about 3 hungry people.  Also, if you are going as a group of guys, plan on getting 1 entree for 2 people.  If you are going with women, typically a single entree can feed 4 people.  Thus, with a mix of people in your group, plan for 3 people per entree.  The restaurant will tell you otherwise, but you will be hungry if you don't plan accordingly.  All-in-all, the food is quite good.  I would say that the individual dishes at Maggiano's are a little bit better, but the price is a little higher for a group to eat there (since eat dish is about $20 per person or higher).",6/14/2014 23:38,36.2012022,-115.2811289,2267 N Rampart Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89128,"Hawaiian, Restaurants",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Aloha Island Grill

We recently had sandwiches with salads and that's when I discovered that their Olive Oil & Rosemary bread is my favorite!

The cheesecake is perfect, the pretzel rolls are also a favorite of mine, and I've tried so many of the desserts and sweets, I couldn't name them all but they're yummy!

They specialize in organic, natural and gluten-free recipes. They don't take shortcuts and if you want good food made from scratch, you'll find it here. Prices reflect the quality ingredients they use. No preservatives or GMOs.

This monthly food and fundraising event has been a nice treat in the Southwest area of town. In the past couple of years, it has really gotten busy though!

Once a month, usually the last Saturday, Chaiya Mediation Monastery holds this food gathering where you can grab homemade treats for $5 or less. It starts around 9 am and lasts until 12 pm or so. But these days, they run out of the popular food items way before noon. So come early if you want your pick!

You can trade your cash for tokens but it's really unnecessary now since all the vendors take cash directly.

Among my absolute favorites are:

* Burmese Tea Salad - I love Burmese Tea Salad and I have not found one restaurant in Las Vegas that makes it. (If you know otherwise, please let me know!) The only thing is that it's not a regular item there. It's only been available a few times unfortunately. (Which makes me want it even more!)

* Mango Sticky Rice - Okay, who doesn't love this Thai dessert? Sweet rice with ripe mangoes, what's not to love? However, it's a seasonal thing and they run out fast! You need to be there early to score an order.

* Pad Thai - Made to order and a bargain for the amount you get!

* Pork Satay - Made to order and $1/stick. Put your order in and come back to get it later on. Some months it's super tender, other months it's only okay.

Other food items found:

* Hainanese Chicken and Rice
* Papaya Salad (spicy!)
* Curry Puffs (You need to order these a month in advance!)
* Soups
* Chive Pancakes
* Sweet Roti Pancakes
* Desserts

I was spoiled in the beginning because the Husband would head out and pick up the food while I slept in. It was a nice treat finding all these goodies waiting for me in the kitchen. But now it's a much longer wait to get your food because it's so crowded. Nonetheless, I'm glad the monastery is getting so much business and visitors. They could probably extend the amount of food vendors each month to accommodate the demand.

I'm not normally a complainer - I'm the Customer Relations Manager for a place with well over 1.1 million customers per year, so I see all sorts of customers and hear all sorts of crazy complaints, but this place really made me angry, so I had to post.

The lady we had (pretty sure she was the manager), basically berated and belittled us for not taking their insurance. We are covered up to $50,000 through our credit card, but she very loudly tried to convince us otherwise (talking about the 'loss of business' they would charge us if we damaged the car). If we're only paying $30 a day for a car, no chance in hell am I paying the $65 a day she was suggesting for insurance. She was friendly until we declined the insurance, then she was straight up unpleasant. My husband kept pushing me to walk away and go somewhere else, but we stuck it out.

We then got to the car... It was a disaster. It was damaged and scratched all over the outside - so they're clearly not taking care of the cars! We started filling out the triplicate sheet showing damage, and by the time we were done, there was no space left to write. No exaggeration. We also took 34(34!!!!!!!!!!!) time stamped pictures of 34 different scratches, scrapes, and dents on the exterior of the car. No way was I going to get stuck with paying for someone else's damage because they were taking advantage of the fact that we didn't get railroaded into their insurance (I feel like she gave us that car because we said no). The inside was fine, but a little dirty.

Also, if you drive less than 75 miles, make sure you keep your gas receipt, otherwise they'll charge you a ridiculous fuel price. Seriously, read the fine print, there's lots of things to look out for! We kept documentation of everything in case they try to charge us anything!!M

I use to like this place but after my meal on Monday 5/20/19 im never coming back here again.  We came at 5pm and ordered 3 hainan chicken meals.  The waitress brings out the plates with no rice and says she just came on and had no idea there was no rice. This was at no fault of hers but the attempt to serve the meal with no hainan rice which is the main purpose of the meal was insulting to the meal itself.  How do you not have rice at 5pm prime dinner time and why would you attempt to serve it without rice?  Waitress says that it will be 15 minutes for rice to be ready so we decide we can wait. She takes the hainan plates back.  Appetizer of chicken wings, fries, and a chicken bao comes out. The fries and wings are decent. The chicken in the chicken bao was overcooked.  Keep in mind our interactions between the waitress was always very polite.  Never rude or demanding.  We ask if we can get a new chicken bao because it was overcooked.  The waitress says yes we can.  The waitress took the chicken bao back to the chef to make a new one.  By this time the rice is done and our meals come out with rice. The rice was obviously a rush job and the broth that was served was most likely the same broth that was served to us 15 minutes ago because it was cold.  We don't want to be a pain so we just forgave it and kept eating.  The hainan chicken was slightly overcooked.  The natural moisture of the chicken was gone.  We forgave it and kept eating.

*** As I am eating I am definite in overhearing the chef talking sh*t about having to remake the chicken bao.  The waitress said she brought it back because the chicken was overcooked.  The chef said it wasnt overcooked and he never heard that before and complained.  I would have chalked this experience of being a one off but after I heard the chef complaining and denying the overcooked chicken I will never come back.  We were polite the whole time and never complained once about everything they got wrong such as the hainan chicken rice plate with no hainan chicken rice, getting served cold broth, and getting served an overcooked chicken bao. After politely asking if we could get a new one and they said yes, then to hear complaining about it? That was the last straw.  *** I wrote a small note on the receipt about this hoping it would make its way back to management.

So we decided to take a chance and go anyways. We arrive and it isn't that busy.. so my sister wanted to test out if they really had a phone or not.. she calls as we re standing at the doorway and we hear a phone, still no one answers. Wow. Anyways, so our wait time was 25 minutes. After being seated it took 20 minutes to order an appetizer, another 40 for the waiter to finally take our order.. 30 minutes for our food to come AND THEN ANOTHER 30 minutes to get us our check. It didn't take us long to eat (20 minutes) bc the food isn't what some of these reviews say it is. That calamari was 90% all breaded AND SALTY. The prime rib tasted like the prime rib you'd get from their buffet but the buffet costs a lot less than that prime rib itself, their N.Y. steak and porterhouse was so so, oh! & you have to pay almost $10 extra for a side.

2)  We were charged $125.  This was supposed to be based on the size of our home.  Also based on the size of our home, though, the cleaning service was supposed to be for 2:45 - 4 hours.  After the 2nd hour, my husband called me at work to tell me that the cleaners were ready to leave claiming that they were done with the cleaning;
3)  The office, when I called them, confirmed that we were scheduled for about 3 1/2 - 4 hours of cleaning.  The cleaner, however, insisted with me on the phone that they were told that they were only getting paid for 2 1/2 hours and that the person in the office who was telling me otherwise must have something wrong with her brain;
4)  The cleaners also insulted our home by telling my husband that it was too dirty.  For your information, my husband just cleaned our home about 5 days ago.  Furthermore, if it was in fact as dirty as they claimed it was, how come it only took them 2 hours to supposedly clean everything?
5)  They did not sweep and mop our floors at all;
6)  They did a hap hazard job at cleaning our kitchen counters that I had to re-do them when I got home;
7)  We had to request that they vacuum the walk-in closets and their excuse for not doing so from the beginning was because the doors were closed - obviously not locked since our closets have no locks;
8)  Their first email said that we had to request oven cleaning ahead of time but it also said that if time permits it will be done...well, they were supposedly finished cleaning within 2 hours and at no time did they make any attempts to clean inside the oven;
9)  I do understand Spanish so when my husband called me and told them to speak to me, I heard the 2 women speaking to each other in Spanish, insulting my husband;
10)  They did not vacuum under the beds, even though we have the kinds that are high enough that the floor/carpet is exposed;

But my teen daughter had really good grades and she wanted to see the glitz of the strip and the shops and the fountains, etc. so I booked the cheapest rates without being 'off-strip"". CES was coming in this week, so that was not an easy feat, either. I digress...

This review is for the room. In the Pyramid, 22 floors up. I am not very comfortable being in a totally enclosed hotel (look it up...carbon monoxide is a silent killer). So that is one star off, but I knew that was coming. 

The room itself was what was expected. Clean. I would have liked a coffee machine of some sort so I would not have to get dressed and pay $6 for a latte at Starbucks in the casino. I small fridge would have been nice. Ironing board/Iron was provided. Not needed. 

Now the 2nd star missing: No wireless internet access. Who carries a laptop anymore? My tablet stayed in the suitcase. 

The shower floor was sluggish. The maid has to clean soap scum off the floor of that shower every day...you would think he/she would tell someone that it needs to be dealt with. The toilet was SO low-flow that TP did not flush unless you dropped it directly on the water in the bowl. The travertine tiled shower was obviously new...too bad they could not get the plumbing right.

And the bathroom fan! NO conversation could happen in that room when the bathroom light was on because of that turbofan blowing/sucking. ""WHAT? WHAT DID YOU SAY??"" Nobody was able to primp/makeup/brush teeth without that annoying noise. Make a separate switch for the fan, please. 

I never saw concierge service. I guess it was there. But the concierge desk at Excalibur and Monte Carlo were very nice.

This place does get pretty crazy during Halloween weekend; it's really fun to see people's costumes and take pictures with total strangers. And like every club in Vegas, Surrender has its pros and cons. 

As for the pros, the place is BEAUTIFUL. It's a mostly outdoor with a small indoor area with a bar near the dance floor and where the pole dancers are. I really like that there are bridges going across the pools (it makes me wonder how many [drunk] people have fallen into the pool while walking across). Like XS, there's some gaming tables inside as well and lots of outdoor breathing room if you wanna take a break from dancing. And if you want a break from the big crowds of XS, Surrender is a great alternative to check out.

And the cons. The dance floor is kinda small but I didn't mind this too much because it gets you walking around to check the whole venue out. It's another club that's getting into the trend of playing house music (which can be a pro and/or a con, depending on if you like/love house music). Also, you know you've been in Surrender too long when they start repeating songs. Drinks are expensive but that comes with the territory of clubbing in Vegas.

Really this review is about the ambience on that evening, perhaps it is not the best assessment because I disliked the entertainment so much. The bar itself is cool, small but homey. Have a couple of beers on tap, nothing too fancy. But the comedy that night left much to be desired. The comics started around 9ish; pretty much all of them white males. The majority of the jokes centered around sex and women. I think these men are what one would call 'man child', as their jokes really were very immature. Don't get me wrong, I am a very open-minded individual and feel that comedy in this country tends to be very politically correct. But a lot of the jokes I heard that night were about domestic violence, attacks against minority groups, etc. There was also an abundance of pedofilia and priest jokes. And interestingly enough, a lot of talk about abortions (might I have found some supporters that night?). This will sound harsh, but it seems like these men are afraid of women. Not one made eye contact with me and I am not an intimidating person. We stook around for a good two hours because we just couldn't get over what was happening.

I couldn't find black sesame on the menu so I was looking at the ice cream in the display for the flavor I wanted. Or if i wanted to switch to a boba. I didn't want to go home empty handed. 

I finally had to wave one of the girls down to even look up and ask about flavors, she gave me the attitude that I was bothering her.  At this point I decided to leave and go elsewhere. I ended up at chinatown for some snow ice cream which was delicious!

It is an impressive display of history that tells a unique story from beginning to end in a moderately interactive way.  Located in the beautiful old Post Office and Court House in Downtown Las Vegas you nearly forget where you are but never where we all came from.  Some cynics may argue that the museum is glorifying the mob.  On the contrary.  It does, however, tell the story of how the mob came to power across the United States. How they were instrumental in building Las Vegas into the grand city it is today.  How the mob changed the face of our national politics.  Finally, how the law fought back.  You start on the third floor of the old building.  One of very few old places still standing in our ever changing town.  As you walk through learning about the early days, you come across interactive displays like a Thompson ""Tommy"" machine gun simulator.  You aim at a target and pull the trigger.  You feel the recoil.  You hear the bulletts flying and the shells falling.  As you  move on you find a replica of an electric chair that was used on the most dangerous of organized criminals.  You will find actual clothing and other artifacts used by infamous mobsters throughout the 20th century.  As you work your way down to the first floor through the cohesive timeline, you will learn more than you ever knew was possible and get to know the men like Benny ""Bugsy"" Seigle and Al Capone on a deeper and more personal level.  You get to know the hard hitting Kefauver who led the fight against the mob.  Finally, you end in the gift shop.  In there are the customary shot glasses and t-shirts.  There are also some nice novelty items like brass knuckle meat tenderizors or can coozies with a pistol grip.  The museum may not be seeing the attendance they had hoped for but that did not keep Tuesday afternoon from seeing a fair number of guests.  I think it would be a bigger draw were it cheaper for more than just locals.  $10 with a Nevada ID is reasonable but $20 for out-of staters will possibly steer some would be guests away as does the $5 parking.

When this place first opened few years ago, the food was amazing, the variety was outstanding, and even the presentation of the food was novel and wonderful and always brought a smile to my face.

Over the years , the food and the selection remained good enough to keep me coming back, but I definitely had noticed it slowly declining.  Now though, the experience itself has gotten so bad that I'm not sure I'll ever be back.

We went at 6pm on a Monday night.  The wait was 40 minutes to get in, but that was really ok; I pretty much expect that.  But this time, once we were inside there were more lines to wait on.  The seafood area, and carving board area both had huge lines.  In the past, there might be a slight wait before one could get through these areas, but on this night there was a loooong wait for both, which was very unpleasant.  Not only that, there were people that would get to the head of the line and then have friends and family members (that had NOT waited on line) come up with their empty plates, and would then fill those plates.  It was if mom was in her own kitchen serving her family members.  This of course added to the wait for the rest of us.

In addition, the service was awful.  In the past, the servers cleared plates quickly, were attentive, and refreshed drinks and water quickly, and would check as one started in on dessert and then offer coffee or whatever.  On this particular night, our plates piled up and were infrequently cleared.  Although, I did find a soda had been refreshed at one point while I was away from the table, I was never able to get my water refilled once, even though I had consumed the first glass upon arrival.  I also could never flag down someone to get coffee. And finally at one point, I realized that the table that was right next to us (very close), had been vacated by diners and then became the dumping ground where servers piled up dirty dishes.  Every inch was filled, and the pile was easily a foot high.  Not very pleasant.

I would say that the food is still fairly good, but the overall experience makes it NOT worth the price.  I'm wondering if it's just because they're letting in too many people at once.  I'm not sure this is the case, but my perception is that in the past, they controlled entry so that there were less people inside at once.  That would certainly make the individual food lines more reasonable, and give the poor overworked servers a chance to be able to keep up, and make for a MUCH better customer experience.

It is very expensive for a buffet, and I have come to the conclusion that my (same amount of) money would be better spent at one of the many, many Vegas restaurants where I would not waIt on line after line, enjoy a great meal, have attentive service and have a more civilized experience.",8/16/2016 17:39,36.1669489,-115.1340026,1028 Fremont St,NV,Las Vegas,89101,"Coffee Roasteries, Restaurants, Cafes, Food, Bakeries, Coffee & Tea",Restaurants,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Mothership Coffee Roasters

Lobster risotto.   It could of had a few more pieces of lobster but was really good and flavorful
  
My husband had the filet mignon and he said it was awesome.  There is a nice streak house in Green Valley called Hanks and he said hands down a way better steak than Hanks.   Plus, Hanks steaks are way more expensive.

I had the salmon.  Wow, fresh tasting, melted like butter.   Loved this dish.

Don't enjoy seeing others paying more, but also respect those trying to make a buck. Still, it's been a couple of months and my consciencePLUS won't let this go. Went in for oil change. The guy who 'confronts' you and takes your keys is a bit in your face. Demanding. Wants fast decisions. Again, I was there only for an oil change. 

This guy - inches from my face, tells me that I'm due for an air cleaner (air filter) and a cabin air filter for $99. He's got a clipboard in his hands, a power clipboard that makes anything written on it an emergency. (Does it ever occur to guys with pens in their hands that they're talking to people who know more then them when it comes to cars?) I just looked at him. I was expecting him to laugh and say he's kidding. He didn't. I said, don't worry, I'll handle it. For those who do not know, it takes about five minutes to change the air filter under the hood and about three minutes and forty-three seconds to change the cabin filter and that's if you're doing it for the first time.  The cost of both together is about $30 in filters (See Amazon or AutoZone.) You can use better filters than Honda recommends, but the cheaper ones they use will do you fine.   So, I changed my air and cabin filters (STP) two days later. Easy. The car only had 15k miles, is garage kept and babied. If you never changed these two filters go to YouTube videos. No emergency for normal drivers. Advice: When you go for an oil change, don't be intimidated. People were falling like flies and walking out with their fingers in their ears after signing the power clipboard listing all the suddenly important services.  While waiting for oil change a woman was throwing a fit and practically crying that she came in for oil and ended spending $400 for all the things on this guy's service list that would cost much, much less at a Big O Tire Store who do a great job.  The requested prices asked by Honda are ridiculous. Okay, back to oil change= About to pay for the oil change the guy who likes to get in your face and intimidate you into saying yes to buying more service, told me that my filters FAILED INSPECTION and that they were rated EXCESSIVELY DIRTY, and he said it like I WAS DIRTY and was I sure I didn't want to pay the $99 to replace them. What he didn't realize is that I stood watching the oil change and never did the Tech inspect either filter. You must get inside the car to get to the cabin filter--he didn't!  Did I tell him I knew? No. I'm a calm dude and didn't want to embarrass this dealership who treated me well when I purchased the car. Now, did I believe the filters could possibly be excessively dirty? No! (Even then I didn't write this review.) Anyway, found my paper work recently from the oil change in glove compartment, and realized that when I was there, Power Clipboard Man, who didn't get to steal my $99 and who rated by filters (both) as failed inspection and noted them to be ""excessively dirty"", made that lie a part of my car's record. That, my conscience, and the image of this guy seeing people as no more than suckers finally got me to write this review.",11/15/2018 18:07,36.158671,-115.12591,1730 E Charleston,NV,Las Vegas,89104,"Event Planning & Services, Delis, Restaurants, Caterers, Sandwiches",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Port of Subs

I have an extremely large & long beard & thin but full head of hair. Once my barber knows me as a person they understand exactly where I'm going with my CUT&TRIM (as I like to call it. I've been there 4 times & I have to say each barber & Cosmotologist has been fantastic! Stephanie, Britt, Ryan, & today Rica. 

Stephanie was amazing. She even recommended waxing my nose (never have I ever done this & ive done it all lol. I continue to look forward to having it done every time now). I have a photo from her I'll attach (not of the nose).

Ryan was outstanding. Did a fabulous job.

Britt just did the nose wax but it was still great & nearly painless (it still hurts a little). 

And Rica, I believe has finally won me over. She knew exactly what I want. She knew what to do with excess beard hair, how to properly allow it to grow out so I don't look like I have a bow cut & understood that I needs to bite the Bullet to let the Stache grow until it stops being eaten up by my mouth. Lol. I don't have any photos as it still is a stressful process going through it & I took up more of her time then I needed too & then she needed to give; without saying anything to me.

The prices are a little higher then Miami Beach (where I moved from a year ago; that's surprising for Vegas) but overall they are still really good for the quality.

When my friends and I showed up, I was shocked to see they actually still had George T Stagg available, since it's so hard to find anywhere these days.  I asked the bartender how much it was and she replied that it was $70 shot. I laughed and mentioned how ridiculously overpriced that was, and she said back to me that ""anywhere in Vegas, they take the average purchase price of the bottle and market up to 2x"". While I agree with her, and I've purchased Stagg in town for $30 shot, that was not at all the case here and her assuming I'm a tourist made the comment even worse. I glanced at other items on the menu including a $36 shot of angels envy, of which you can find an entire bottle for $45 at a liquor store.  Simply a straight up lie. Fortunately she went on to serve somebody else, and we got a different bartender. Maybe I should use another word than ""fortunately"", because this guy poured the drinks we ordered but tried to up charge us on one item that was $10 to a higher price $25. When I got the bill, I called him out for it and he tried to convince us that he poured the $25 bottle as he brought the bottle in front of us showed us the exact thing that we ordered. I couldn't tell if he was intentionally being dishonest or he was just stupid and couldn't read the label. The bartender continued to act like he was right as we were pointing out to him on the bottle that he's wrong. Eventually he refunded me the money and we begrudgingly go upstairs to enjoy the drinks. 

That should've been the end of the issues, but upstairs we ordered some almonds and cherries. We also ordered another round of the $10 shot and clearly expressed that's the one we wanted and not the $25 one, of which the waitress said that the $10 one is the only one they have in stock. How does the waitress know this, and the bartender conveniently not?  Oh, and guess what we never got, but it showed up on the bill... yep... $20 worth of almonds and cherries. 

Three encounters with employees, two of which tried to charge us for things we didn't get and one that straight up lies about the pricing comparisons in Vegas, while effectively lecturing like we don't know any better. This place was certainly not about the customer and is clearly way more concerned with their bottom line and anything else. No thanks to my business going forward and this bourbon drinker will go somewhere else and share this story with as many bourbon drinkers going forward. 

The bourbon selection is the only reason this isn't 1 Star.

The next day, I submitted payment and was sent my full report. All I can say is ""WOW."" For a 3 bed, 2 bath home, the report was 95 PAGES! He took hundreds of photos and documented every single little thing. Good/bad, big/small, inside/outside.. EVERYTHING WAS INCLUDED.

First I would like to say the only person that I had a decent experience from was the lady taking my bets in the sports book. She had long blonde hair. And was very helpful and knowledgeable with helping me understand ""the lines.""

Other than that...
The room smelt funny, like moldy.
The sports book smelt like poop from the bathroom that was right next door to the sports book...

I complained to the front desk and it took them 2 days to fix the smell and the way they fixed it was just by closing the bathroom down all together. Maybe they need to hire a different cleaning crew...

The casino filtration system is terrible so you really feel like your breathing in 2nd hand smoke.

The employees at the front desk were rude when I complained about the bathroom next to the sports book. Maybe that's why they didn't fix it when I complained about it the first day it happened. They must of had other complaints...

I felt like the employees didn't want to listen to me and my complaints/suggestions because I'm a younger man so they didn't take me seriously, but little did they know I was here for almost 2 weeks and spent over 2000 in their casino and hotel. 

I will never come back to this place.

So this is my evaluation.

Hotel: casino and rooms... Gross.

Staff: (excluding the lady in the sports book) Rude

Food: Buffet was gross most of the food looked like it'd been sitting there for a while besides the food where the guy is cutting the meat off for you...

The pizza Hut which isn't apart of hotel undercooked my pizza. I had hotel staff connect me or attempt to connect me 3 times and they hung up on me every time last time I called and sat outside the pizza Hut and watched the manager walked out while I was attempting to talk to a manager. This is when I decided I need to review this hotel and my awful experience...

I'm tempted to knock a star off of every Vegas review just for being in Vegas.  That said, I thought that the Flamingo was decent.  

Pros: 
- Comfy beds
- Winding pool with waterfalls, lots of beach chairs,  a kid area, and several bars.
- Location - totally central on the strip, near Caesar's Palace, Paris and the Bellagio (among many others).  It's a more affordable option than the other hotels in that area.

Cons:
-The place seemed pretty dirty.  There were food scraps scattered about the hallways, stains all over the carpets, and just a general grimy feel about it.
-We had technical issues with the TV in our room and had to call down several times to get it fixed (Don't have TV at home so we were super excited to indulge in it); 
-Requested a king bed, received a room with two queen beds instead

I so far have gone back 4x (every 3 weeks) since my original appointment with Liz and my lashes last over 3 weeks. Everyone compliments me on my lashes and I always always recommend this place)

Came to the buffet to get the crab legs.I know they have two sides to the buffet as they combined the seafood buffet together with the regular buffet.But they offered crab legs on both sides before.  Now you can only get crab legs if you pay an extra 20.00 on top of the 32.99. One other comment is that servers use to give you your drinks now they have soda machines and you get your own. When you go to Vegas and pay 32.99 for a buffet you don't expect to get your own soda, that cheapens your experience  You can go to your local 9.99  buffet and get your own soda.

Tip: buy a bottle of water in the gift shop for $4 to save a buck or 2 if you order outside at the pool bar.

Writing this now because I'm done and moving out.

The jacuzzi in the pool area was filled in with concrete this past winter, no communication sent out on that, just was walking by and realized it.

I was coming out to Vegas and had 3 nights booked at New York New York.  I had a last minute opportunity to come to Vegas 2 nights early, so I decided to look at hotel options.  Seeing that the Las Vegas hilton's price dropped from 299/night to 104/night at the last minute..I decided to help them fill the hotel.  

The hotel - I realize that this is the Las Vegas strip, and everything costs extra...but I really felt nickled and dimed at this hotel.  From the 3.50 bottled water at the pizza hut (4.00 in the room), to the 13.99/night internet, to the 6.75 bottles of beer at the bar.  The bright spot was the free parking, though that seems to be fairly standard out here.   The star trek experience was closed down... which was disappointing even though I'm not a trekkie.  The location of the hotel is not ON the strip... It's either a short walk, or a monorail ride away.

As a hilton diamond member, I received a room ""upgrade"".  Apparently the upgrade only gave me a bigger tv, and a more comfortable bed.  Considering the VERY limited channel selection, the big tv was rather pointless...though the bed was quite cozy.  (I guess the big tv might be nice if you decided to rent movies to watch) If you are a hilton gold or diamond member, make SURE to bring your hiltonhonors card along.  Without it, you don't get your free breakfast buffet, or free fitness center access.  (Even if they already have your number on file)

The room - I liked the great water pressure in the shower.  I also thought the ""hydraulic toilet seat"" was a nice touch.  However, the negatives outweighed the positives.  The shower was designed for midgets.  The showerhead was literally at chest height for me... and I'm only about 6 feet tall !!!!.  Squatting while showering is NOT a comfortable experience.   The weather was rather chilly during my stay, and the heater didn't work worth a darn.  It literally took about 5 hours to get the room to a comfortable temperature with the heat cranked to maximum.  The windows were so dirty that it looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in years.  I realize that dust blows around in the desert, but it certainly shouldn't be THAT bad.  Add in the long wait for elevators in my tower, and it made the entire experience less than desirable.

(i know... i write a list but i forget to bring it... hello... lol) anyway i was just a ride along today and nothing really to buy but like always you end up finding something to buy...

This market has pretty much everything there... and the prices are very good... i believe they are workers owned and so that's why they can pass on the savings to their shoppers... you can sign up online to get even more savings by getting coupons that when you check out you just put in your phone number and whatever coupon you clicked it applies it when you pay and you get even more discounts... you can sign up online for free... being a member is worth it...

They have a bakery with all kinds of fresh baked goods and you can special order custom made cakes as well... their deli is awesome to so many cold cuts that you can even taste to see if you like it or not... they have all kinds of sides and the hot food... oh the hot food one of my favorites... the salt and vinegar wings is so ONOLISHOUS! The lemon salt is my second favorite... they also have sweet sour, regular fried, salt and pepper and they have rotisserie chicken too... and you can't forget the potato wedges...

They have sushi too... not bad goes well with the wings... my other favorite is the bulk food... i go for the snacks and candy... all kinds of gummy candy, nuts, grains, rice, pasta, chocolates, spices and snacks... you can take what you want and just write the number on the twisty tie and your good to go...

Yes... i love this market they have everything under the sun... snacks, vegetables, fruits, beverages,  baby stuff, meats, seafood, can goods, spices, dressings, breakfast foods, frozen foods, dairy products, toys, pinyatas, jerky, seafood, household goods, medical care and medications... and so much more...",2/16/2019 20:28,36.159951,-115.147464,"Soho Lofts, 900 S Las Vegas Blvd, Ste 120",NV,Las Vegas,89101,"Food, Local Flavor, Grocery",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Resnicks Grocery
3fu-6RqUCGyTlW6UqzgSYg,leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,4,4,0,2,"This review is for the Sunday jazz brunch. I will start by saying that I read many reviews before going. I think this helped. The other thing to say is that your experience depends on where you are sitting because that will decide on how your service is, due to the waiters that will be attending to your table.
The cons: The first time we went to brunch, we sat outside. The service was not very good and we asked to sit inside. The service was way better. Today, we sat right by the jazz band. It was way too loud to have a conversation and the service was just so-so.
Pros: The jazz is great but I would recommend sitting away from the band in order to be able to have a conversation. It was fun and lively and the band was very very good. The food: delicious. You have to come hungry. I would recommend not eating anything until you get there. There are two components to the brunch: the first is the actual buffet brunch, which has lovely salads, followed by fresh seafood including fresh shrimp, crab legs, scallops that are fresh, and oysters that are fresh. From there, they have sushi rolls which were seriously delicious. They have a wonderful meat station with everything from pork to prime rib to sausage and more. From there, they have a grits and shrimp station that rivals New Orleans impressively. I had just come back from New Orleans and was completely doubtful that I would ever have grits as good as I had there again. The shrimp and grits at this restaurant were as good and an absolute star of the buffet for me. From there, there is a station of wonderful bakery goods from fresh bagels to lovely pastries, salmon that is fresh, cream cheese, and several other items. There is also a menu that the kitchen has, which is free to anyone having the brunch. It included six items, including poached eggs with crab, a farm fresh omelette, sliders, wagyu hotdog, French toast bread pudding, and a lovely crepe with spinach and cheese. We had five of the items, excluding the hotdog, and they were all absolutely delicious. I would suggest only ordering one dish at a time because the buffet is plentiful and you get full quickly. They also do not take that long to come out so it is easy to order one thing at a time. Once all this is completed, there is a dessert station. There is a candy bar which was great for the kids, and it has M&Ms, gummy bears, taffy candy, truffles that look like cake pops, and several other yummy goodies. There is then a large vitrine of incredible desserts, small cakes like you would find at a high-end bakery like Jean Philippe or Payard, and it is self serve. From chocolate mousse to dark chocolate Bombe to a fresh pannacota to a strawberry shortcake to a Keylime pie to a fresh fruit tart... and more! The dessert bar is unbelievable! It is sinful and not merciful to those on a diet.
Suggestions: the brunch is about $64 per person, so I would not recommend it for small children unless you have extra money to spare. There is an all you can drink option for Bellinis or Mamosa's for 35 extra dollars or an all you can drink exclusive champagne or Bloody Mary for an extra $65. All you can drink is represented in a much classier sense as bottomless. If you are not hungry, then it is not worth it. It is not a cheap brunch so you have to be able to pack in a lot of food to get your value. That is generally very difficult to do so I believe people eat a lot less than the worth of the brunch in many cases.
We liked sitting on the inside a lot better. I did order a Bellini with passion fruit and it was a letdown for me. I will likely not get bottomless drink options myself because I was not impressed. Know that coffee, tea, soft drinks, and juices are free with the brunch.

Recently I decided perhaps I would try their much raved about cheap and yummy breakfast served at their cafe with my sister in tow. She was staying at The Signature at MGM so Ellis Island was very close by.

When we arrived the cafe was busy. Not busy enough for us to not be seated quickly though. Our waitress came by and we were ready to order. There's not much to the breakfast menu, so you don't have a lot to mull over. I ordered the Denver omelet and my sister ordered the french toast with bacon. The prices are quite cheap, but not dirt cheap.

The wait wasn't long. Our food arrived rather quickly considering how many people there were in the place. My food was placed in front of me and I knew then why the food was that quick. I realize a Denver omelet isn't a gourmet meal, but mine looked meh. The green peppers were diced very small. The ham looked as though it had definitely come packaged and sliced into small bits. It tasted meh and it was a bit hard for my tastes. It certainly wasn't a nice, fluffy, soft omelet. The potatoes on the side were overcooked, but okay - nothing special. 

My sister didn't feel good by the time our food came out, so she didn't eat her french toast. I'm not sure if it was good or not. Since we had to retreat quickly since she wasn't feeling well I was able to flag down the server quickly and get our reciept. I think she sensed our urgency and was quick about it, so at least that was nice of her. 

The service, to me, was better than the food.

The presentation is extremely amazing.  They even put the caesar salad in a tiny jar, so you won't waste a lot of food. We were disappointed that they discontinued the chinese ginseng with chicken.

I didn't think the food really stood out to me in general, other than that it was pricy.  High table tops and normal tables were available for sit down meal.

 We decided to share 2 sandwiches,

1. Breakfast sandwich (Skirt steak, fried eggs and oyster mushrooms on a roll )- the best out of the two we ordered.  Mushrooms and skirt steak included.  It was served on a panini style sandwich, which was decent!  These breakfast sandwiches are served all day, which I love!  Who doesn't love breakfast food at any time during the day.

2. Chicken breast, roasted red pepper, mozzarella and pesto on country bread - the chicken was so dry.  least favorite and totally not worth it.

I happened to be in the area of Big Chicken with hubby so we stopped by not knowing it was new, or that it was Shaq's restaurant. The menu was short and sweet but had enough diversity to make me think before I ordered. I settled on the Superman aka ""The Cali Fried Chicken Sandwich"" For those of you from CA you know we don't eat anything without  avocado on it! 
The restaurant was full but not packed. We ordered
and choose to sit at the bar because I also wanted a drink. The bar has about 15 chairs and two big screens. It was the perfect balance of a relaxing upscale sports bar without the overwhelming noise. 
Or food came out in about 15 min and was fresh! fresh! fresh! 
I wasn't prepared for what happened next...
Sure it was a nice vibe and all but I wasn't expecting to be transported back to Alabama with the first bite! I was genuinely confused!! I took a second bite and looked at my husband.... ""what is this"" I literally looked around the restaurant for a min in disbelief.... 
The chicken was perfectly Crisp on the outside, and juicy on the inside. It was southern backyard home fried. For those of you who aren't familiar I'll explain. Southern seasoned fried chicken has so many herbs on it when it's fried you'd think it was burnt looking at it from the outside, but that's just the black peppers & herbs. Saying it was ""really good"".... would be the understatement of the year. If I had paid 15.00 bucks for the sandwich I still would have walked out feeling like I got the better end of the deal. 
When my drink came I was a little worried because I didn't ask for a drink menu I just ordered. I was pretty sure the bartender was about to hand me a tab for 25.00 based on the size. PEOPLE IT WAS 5.41 !!!! Hubby and I shared it!

First off... good looking girls as waitresses... Guinness came quick (but not too quick, leading me to believe that they know what they are doing) and the Black & Tan was heavy on the tan...  Good start.

My steak looked delicious and like it came out of a photo shoot.  Kyle's C-B&C looked equally cool.  So far this is a solid 4 star joint.  I ordered my steak medium-rare because the only gravy I like on my mashed potatoes is the blood from my steak.  Obviously, there are better places for steak (this is Vegas for crissakes), but steak is on the menu so I'm going to hold them accountable for knowing how to cook one.  

As I mentioned, the steak looked beautiful, and I cut into it and I got a good amount of juice action, but it tasted like it was over cooked... I kept thinking to myself... Their grill must be like on something as hot as the surface of the sun and incinerated the grill marks into this chunk of meat.  I continue to eat it and it tastes well done but looks medium rare...  then towards the end of the steak, when you have cut enough off and it is now taller that it is wide (it was a nice thick steak) and if falls over... I spotted it.  Bottom side was blacker than Wesley Snipes.  

To quote Randal from Clerks: 
""I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am..."" 
""You're cunning attempt to trick me""

It was a good steak, but someone set fire to one side of it and it wasn't even busy in the restaurant... no excuse... Kyle totally dug the corned beef, but then again he isn't on Yelp.

Despite my steak complaints I actually would go back to this place because everything else was solid, but I would ask for a bloody ass steak and then check the plate side before eating it...

My gripe isn't the food but the service and management. So I ordered Beef Noodle Soup, which only a few minutes soon after, I grabbed the waitress's attention and requested my order to be substituted with wide noodles. Keep in mind, the food did not hit my table yet. The waitress said that it's already made (as in the kitchen) so my request had to be declined. 

I'm never the one to feel entitled, I'm super understanding, and try to find a middle ground. Rather, she chose to shove this deal breaker to me. As this bowl of soup and noodles is skated onto my table, I'm just looking at my order as if it was forced upon me. I wasn't pleased as a customer, it wasn't the exact order which I had asked for, but yet, I'm expected to not only pay, but also eat it in misery. Out of all places, I chose Noodle Pot. And yet, this is how they chose to treat a regular. If they were smart about their business, with just a small accommodation, they could of made money on the ROI. As I continuously kept returning, especially with friends and family.

Long story short, I told the waitress/cashier lady that I don't think it's right to charge me for something I didn't eat. I initially was going to pay for my order but I pulled my card out because it didn't sit right with me. I said I didn't eat it because it is not what I requested as an order. She blamed me for not requesting wide noodles from the get go. She said she would modify my order and ring me up a new order as long as I paid for the first order. So essentially, she wanted me to pay for two orders. These bowls are $13 each. And I know they're also expecting a tip. She said she was the supervisor and I asked to speak to someone above her. 

I was handed the phone with the manager to come to a resolution. As I'm explaining to the manager over the phone, he tells me that the waitress said that I've already ate the food. The phone was passed back and forth as they're speaking in Chinese and I'm explaining over the phone to the manager in English. Furious and frustrated, I told him that I'm not paying, and with that said, that I won't return back. The manager said and I quote, ""yeah don't comeback, we don't want people like you, but you still have to pay"". I wasn't going to leave cheated and hungry. And I didn't really want to simply walk out because it is not right. But I did coz i don't hand over my money to bad servicing cheaters.",6/10/2018 22:52,36.155728,-115.334217,11011 W Charleston Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89135,"Restaurants, Chinese, Fast Food",Restaurants,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Panda Express

Verdict? It was even better! This is one of Bobby Flay's restaurants located inside Caesar's Palace, and man, he puts some awesome dishes on the menu!

For all you carb fans, the bread basket here is fantastic! It's filled with jalapeño sourdough, cornbread muffins, and raisin bread. Many of the appetizers looked good, but after seeing the portions of other entrées coming out, my husband and I thought we would try to save any extra room we had for dessert instead. 

The last time I came here, I ordered the cornmeal encrusted chili relleno, and though it was excellent (and the prettiest chili relleno I ever saw on a plate), I wanted to try something new this time. I opted for the mango spice encrusted tuna steak served on a bed of couscous with mango chunks and pine nuts. Holy deliciousness, Batman! The flavors of this dish just explode in your mouth!

My husband ordered a veal chop, which was equivalent to the size of his head. No joke... check the pictures I posted. It came with a side of blue cheese smashed tamale, which was both interesting and tasty.

What little room we saved for dessert, we decided to go with something seasonal... pumpkin! So we ordered a pumpkin tartlet topped with a scoop of pumpkin ice cream and a dulce de leche sauce. We were both happy we saved room for that. :)

I would not hesitate to come here a third time after two wonderful dining experiences.

Stayed here over the weekend in a Grand Tower Suite.

We had a king bed that was not as soft as I thought it should be. But the the pillows and blankets were really nice. 

Nice flat screen TV, glass desk, couch, coffee table and mirrored walls.

It was lame that they only have a mini fridge filled with drinks you have to buy and no room for our personal drinks.

Our view was pretty nice, but most of it was the roof of the parking structure below.

My favorite thing about the room is probably the bathroom because it was very modern, clean, and bright. They had many towels of all sizes and was enough for at least four people. 

Although the hot water was always too hot or not hot enough. I had difficulty getting it to the right temperature. The shower curtains were two layers of cloth, which I would of preferred one layer to be plastic so that water does not get out.

I would highly recommend parking your car with valet because it's a lot shorter walk. There was a point where Valet was full so we ha to park our car in the parking structure and it was sooooo far away and you have to walk through tunnels, elevators, and stairs just to get back.

The check in/check out lobby also has pineapple fused water and watermelon fused water if you have trouble finding or buying expensive water!

Came here for dinner to celebrate my graduation. We booked the Kitchen Table, which we were quite excited about. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation, only to realize the restaurant had mistakenly double booked the Kitchen Table. The guy from the other party was being a total d*ck, so we decided to let them have the Kitchen Table, especially after the manager (Lorenzo) said he'd let us have our own private dining room and give us a discount.  Plus, we were a tad disappointed that the Kitchen Table, wasn't really in the kitchen...kinda deceiving, if you ask me. We will book the Kitchen Table at the San Diego location next time we go, cause at least that table is in the kitchen, hence the name. 
We sat down in our own private dining area and as Lorenzo promised, we were the only ones in there.  We literally had the waitress (Jennabea) all to ourselves!  It was very nice; Jennabea was fantastic and incredibly attentive!

Anyhow...so the food, as you should know, it's all served family style, and as always, it was all very delicious. Everyone loved their food, there wasn't much left on the plate.  In fact, I had to push my plate away in order to to stop eating.. ha!

It's glassware is tedious to clean and fragile, so expect it to break after a short time. There is a piece of glassware that hovers over the bowl where the vapor enters. This is a constant source of frustration because waxy residue blocks the pathway after a session or two. So you have to clean it almost constantly. I wouldn't mind so much if the glass wouldn't break so easily during cleaning. I ran it through hot water to tease some of the resin out of the holes and gently scrubbed the ends of the glass. After two months I have broken 3 of these pieces, all when trying to remove resin with a pick from the holes.

If you don't mind meticulously cleaning your vape after every session, then you are left with a vape that yields thin vapor. The bowl has to be packed and compressed, after that you can enjoy average vapor quality--albeit very pure due to the all-glass transport of vapor.

I came to shop on a Saturday night and maybe the store was very busy that day. This could be the reason why the store was messy and unorganized. The furniture selection was minimal as was the bric-a-brac section. Clothing racks were crammed full and did not offer anything interesting or designer.

I will try back again soon, but my first impression of this store was luke warm at best.

***UPDATE***
On my last visit I did find a brand new Hugo Boss stretch long sleeve shirt in royal blue (tags attached with an MRP of $135). It was beautiful and only $8.99. I also found a pair of BALLY dress shoes made in Switzerland in excellent condition for $12.99, so the deals are there if you look hard enough.

I can be skeptical of BBQ joints especially when they are in places that just are not known for having BBQ. 

I had the 3 meat plate. I had Ribs, Brisket and Pulled Pork with green beans and bacon and mac and cheese. My plate also came with a roll, pickle slices and onion slices. The mac and cheese was good but not the best I have had. It tasted like it needed more love. It kind of tasted bland. Did not taste like those who put 3 or 4 different cheeses into their recipe. The green beans were good but I think they had like 2 pieces of bacon in the entire bowl. Green beans with bacon should have a little more bacon in it. The rolls do not look like they are fresh baked. Looks like they are just some store bought rolls. Would have been better if the roll was warmed up a little. 

Onto the meats. The meats had some excellent flavor and were very tender. The brisket pulled right apart like it should and was not a bit rubbery. Didn't have much of a smoke ring for smoking over night for 13-14 hours but was very good. 

The ribs were awesome. Meat pulled right off the bone. Had an excellent Texas BBQ flavor to it. They were nice and sweet tasting. You could definitely tell the smoke penetrated the meat on the ribs. They had a great smoke ring and color to them. I think they go best with the sweet BBQ sauce over the regular BBQ sauce.

Like the ribs, the pulled pork had a better smoke coloring to it than the brisket. Pulled pork was done just right. It also goes better with the sweet BBQ over regular BBQ sauce.

My chart placement of the meats would go like this: Ribs, Pulled Pork, Brisket

The customer service was good. Didn't seem to lively though for being such a new place. The guy that served up my dish answered my questions with no hesitation. I did not catch his name. The guy that rang me up was John and the guy that was working with him serving up the dishes was an Asian guy.(Sorry that's all I can describe lol) 


This place has only been open for 5 months and has the potential to be a really really good place. They just need to work on their sides a little bit. At least the Mac and Cheese and the Green Beans with Bacon. I also think the portion size could have been a tad bit bigger for the price. I was partially full when I was done but the food settled quickly. When it comes to BBQ, I want to practically be in a food coma with left overs for the next day.

Food: 4

Pork Rib Noodles with Knife Shaved Noodles: The ribs were cooked perfectly. They had the right amount of seasoning and were super tender. I wasn't a fan of the broth. Because it's supposed to be a chicken and pork based broth, I thought it would be lighter, but it was as dark and heavy as traditional beef noodle soup.

Chicken Chow Mein with Hand Pulled Noodles: The dish was a tad too oily and salty, but it was pretty tasty. The chicken wasn't dry and it had great flavors.

I called an hour before I had to leave my house and asked if I could place my order over the phone, the clerk told me they didn't take orders over the phone and I had to come into the store. I went to the store, walked up to the front where there were three different people working.

I asked her why if I was the only one in the store at that exact moment that needed balloons filled. She told me others had pre-ordered theirs so I had to wait. I was baffled! I expressed to her how I just couldn't believe she couldn't fill up three small balloons, it would take two seconds!

I love that they do offer vegan options, especially their housemade macadamia almond milk. The inside is very spacious and simple in decor. Overall, the food and drinks are yummy, but the service needs some work still. 

The first time I came here, I asked the cashier for her recommendation so I ended up getting the Vesta breakfast sandwich without meat ($7), and today I just realized that's the exact same thing as the cheese & egg sandwich ($5) just $2 more! The cashier should have just told me to get the cheese & egg sandwich! I'm going to assume just that one employee isn't up to par. After a month of being open, I feel that all staff should know all of the menu items, especially since there aren't that many. Also today, I was told that the only sweetener they had was simple syrup by the cashier. After I sat down with my latte, I asked another employee that was walking around and she clarified that they DO have honey! Again, maybe some employees just need more training. 

I wish they had more coffee choices/flavors, but maybe that's coming in the future? Hopefully! I have tried their matcha latte with nut milk and their macadamia almond latte. Both were very good and recommendable. The breakfast sandwich and their avocado toast were great as well. I'm not sure what kind of bun it is that they use on their sandwiches, but it's fluffy and flavorful...almost addicting.

I can only describe her as a taller lady with glasses and brown hair. If you've been to that store I'm positive you know exactly who I am talking about without me describing her any further.

I was there in December 2016. I went for lunch alone while hubby was working. 

I had dim sum. As a vegan it was so much fun to have choices. The waiter I had was an older gentleman and he truly brought me back to last trip to China. This was heavenly. I also had a nice tea with my dim sum. It was very laid back and took my time to enjoy my meal. The food was very very good. The server was very kind and he was very patient with other diners! I can't judge the price because as a Vegan this kind of options are rare so for me it was a lunch that was more than what I would usually choose money wise, but the level of the quality and presentation and taste was a real gem. In the end, it cost me around $40. But it was such a nice experience that I felt that it was worth it.

Ice Pan is located on the 2nd floor promenade at the Harrah's Las Vegas hotel so unless you know about it and come specifically looking for it I doubt that you will ever run into it.

Ordering seems complex but is very straightforward. You start by selecting the base ($5.95) for your ice-cream which could be whole milk, non-fat milk or soy milk, then select the flavor from Strawberry, Mango, Banana, Kiwi, Green Tea, Vanilla, Chocolate, Yogurt, Coffee, Lemon, Pistachio, Mint Chocolate, Red Bean, Watermelon, Pumpkin, or Pomegranate and finally select the toppings of your choice (50c each) from Strawberry, Banana, Kiwi, Mango, chocolate Chip, Blueberry, Walnut, Pineapple, Almond, Granola, Macadamia, Coconut, Marshmallows, Chocolate Syrup, Caramel, Mochi, Lychee, Fruity Pebbles, and\or Raspberry.

I decided to try Red Bean as that is a really difficult ice-cream to get right specially considering that Ice Pan claims it has no artificial coloring, no refined sugars, no extra sodium, and no preservatives. The milk and red beans are basically blended together and then dropped on an ice pan which causes it to instantly freeze. This is then followed by softening the frozen ice-cream by scrapping it up and trashing it around using two metal scrapes. After a minute of repeating this softening process toppings are mixed in and finally the ice-cream is scooped into a cup. I went with mochi toppings as it goes well with red beans which was a good choice as they seemed to pair up perfectly.

Taste wise this is the pinnacle of not-too-sweet, but believe me its good. If Ice Pan can get someone like me who likes sweet ice-cream to appreciate the natural inherent taste of red beans then they are definitely doing something right. Service is excellent. The owner is very friendly and approachable and could easily be a role model for others.

Left completely satisfied so will surely return to try something else the next time I'm in Vegas.",2/19/2015 1:56,36.05644243,-115.2086582,4935 W Warm Springs Rd,NV,Las Vegas,89118,"Nightlife, Food, Bars",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,PT’s Gold

This location is open all night and centrally located in the same parking lot as the Las Vegas Outlet center.  

Definitely your standard BWW.  The front part of the restaurant is a dinning room for families.  The back part is a huge bar, decorated with lots of big screen TVs for game watching.  Along side the bar are bar top tables, which we decided to sit at.  Our server was also the bartender and pleasant to work with.   I slipped him my card at the beginning so I could pay for the meal and he caught the hint, took the card from under the table and did a great job keeping it a secret from my bestie.  

For our meal, we started with the Mozzarella sticks for $6.49 and mini corn dogs for $5.79.  The mozzarella sticks crispy and perfectly breaded on the outside, and gooey mozzarella goodness on the inside.  The marinara dipping sauce made the stick taste like a good cheese pizza!  The corn dogs were literally bite sized hush puppy goodness.  The corn bread batter wasn't overpowering the dog.  There was a dipping sauce for this as well, mustard I think.  It made the corn dogs delicious!  I also decided to get the small boneless wings containing 10 boneless wings.  Parmesan Garlic was my flavor choice.  I liked the wing.  It was battered and super crunchy.  The Parmesan Garlic, on the other hand, was not as good as the actual wing.  It was too tangy and super salty.  It seemed like the wing was drenched in that sauce and very overpowering.  I was not a fan, to be honest.  

Football season is coming up, so you know I'll be at BWW at least couple more times during the season.  I love the service, I love the food, maybe just a different choice of sauce upon my return.

True to it's name, BC serves up large portions of fried chicken. The menu offers chicken fingers, sandwiches, sliders (sorry no bones or wings), and an assortment of fries, mac & cheese and even some ice cream sandwiches. Prices are reasonable, around $8 for a sandwich and a combo sets you back $12. The chicken is juicy and bursting with flavor while managing not be be greasy at all.

Let's start with the service: a kiosk would have had a better personality. No hi, good morning, nothing. Not even thank you for your order, or a sorry when I got your order wrong - Nothing 
We should have been warned when we asked the cashier if the food was good - he said it was ok - great confidence in your food. 
But, it's about the food. So, ordered the combos:  1 hot links, 1 steak, 2 orders of the chicken and ribs. 
The hot Link: it was a a HOT DOG cut in half and put on the grill to get the grill marks on the outside - BUT the inside of the HOT DOG was COLD -that take skill. 
Next: the steak: flavorless, cold, beans colder, rice was old, the roll was the best part.

The food took over an hour to come out. Only 1/6 dishes was edible. The beef was RAW in the middle, the refried beans were grey and looked like diarrhea, and all the food was cold. When we told our waiter the beef was raw he began to get agitated and said it wasn't raw even after showing him.

ZUhlnKxDBwpWQX910TGZZQ,H9ampHaWvX-I1qAsHh-DBQ,a6NLMOuBg3LanFmm7nlaeg,1,4,0,0,"This was not a good experience. 

I'll explain as vaguely as I can, but if you are intending to go, there could be spoilers ahead. If you don't want that, the tldr version is: Poor care and maintenance of the rooms and puzzles lead to a very poor experience for my whole group, where zero concessions were offered or made to correct it.

On to the experience if you want to brave it:

Our first room had 2 of 5 major clue books for a puzzle had covers removed that contained the icons we needed by a previous group. Whoever reset the room did not notice that covers were missing from the books for some reason and we spent most of our time searching elsewhere for the two missing clues. In conversation with team mates, I mentioned that a couple books had covers missing so maybe that wasn't intentional, but it felt like the Game Master was not observing the room or listening in and we were left working other clues while searching for the missing pieces for a good 25 or so minutes.

We were cryptically told at the start of this first room that when we found four ""items"" and had them where we thought they should go to call the GM on the radio we were provided. When we figured out what that was about, we called and the GM brought the game piece that was to be released by a faulty mechanism in to us unceremoniously. They said it was supposed to fall from a hidden door when the mystery pieces were placed correctly. Normally I can forgive this, things break and they had to improvise the best they could, but when compounded by so many other broken and uncared for parts you start to understand this is an overall lack of care and maintenance. While they were in there, we asked about the missing pieces, and realized that covers were in fact removed by previous customers. They just showed us the solution so we could move on to the third room.

In this third room, there were more mechanical issues. Magnets were not powered or working properly and when time ended the GM came in and went through all the puzzles we had no time to get through and for the end part needed our help to hold the parts that should have been held with magnets in place to trigger the end.

On to the second room.

We started off searching for clues. I found a clip board and started reading it, only to realize it was the checklist the GM uses for resetting the room. I called the GM on the Radio to let them know.

We solved a few locks and opened a drawer that turned on a device we'd need to solve the next puzzle. The device turned on, but immediately the light bulb used for it blew out. Again, in any normal situation I can forgive this as poor luck, but the bad experiences were piling on and nothing was offered to compensate for the issues with the first room. Called the GM again on the radio who told us to call when we found the piece we'd know we'd need to use with that device.

The search continues. We eventually get stuck, we know we don't have the piece for that broken item and we need a clue. We radio the GM and they tell us to use the Braille translator to read the item from the filing cabinet. 

We have a filing cabinet, but that's the part we're stuck on and that I just specifically called about. Also, we don't have any Braille translator yet. I ask them to describe how we find the Braille Translator and they describe items that have NOTHING to do with this room. As I'm staring confusedly into the Radio, trying to decipher this weird approach to clue giving, I see that the sticker on the radio has a name for a different room than the one we are in. They gave us the wrong Radio for this room so they think we are in that one and not the one we are in. (Our GM had changed to someone else from before)

Finally we get the pieces we need for the broken light bulb part and we called the GM in. The GM came in and explained how it worked and gave us the next clue.

We get into the second room and it's pitch black. We figure out the way to get a Black Light on, and the puzzle is simple enough. We know how it works and should be able to solve it, but 2 of the 4 letters in black light paint that we need are nearly blacked out. Each letter should be its own color to solve the puzzle, but these two are barely visible anymore to tell what color they are. We needed help from the GM to show us the solution.

We get into the 3rd room, see a keyboard with a monitor. We find lots of clues, and one of them is a password, we put the password in that gave us a code for the final door. Only thing was, there were like 4 puzzles we didn't solve. The GM showed us those and realized that the Keyboard was supposed to be behind a door that was left open during reset. We skipped 4 of the puzzles of this room that would lead to that.

Nothing was offered compensate for our experience. We were given the owner's #, but 1 person in our group had already left a review and he said not going to make it right until that review is removed. Classy move.

-It has a seating area out front, complete with a fire pit for the colder months.
-Drive-thru window when you're on the go.  Easy in and out if you're heading to the 95 freeway (it's on Lake Mead and Tenaya).
-With the hot summer season, my usual order is a large iced green tea with stevia and there are several teas to choose from here:

Cherry Blossom
Earl Grey
Chai Blend
English Breakfast

There were two concerts that night, plus the fact is was Saturday made it very crowded. The 20 minute wait wasn't a problem. The fact that the pager went off to tell us that they were ready to seat us when they weren't was the problem. We had to wait another 10 minutes.  

Be warned that the music is VERY LOUD. You have to yell at everyone which gets old. I'm use to loud music in a club but not when I'm eating.  The redeeming qualities of the music are that the bass is low so you can't feel it in your chest and the mix is arranged nicely.

The milkshakes are really tasty. They range from $11-14. You get two drinks for that price since you also get a completely filled shake container. My boyfriend liked his Korean Bull Gogi burger. I got the chicken and waffle appetizer. It wasn't anything special about it. I like that they gave us a small bucket of popcorn while waiting for our food. It didn't seem to take too long for the food to come out but they gave us popcorn anyway. 

A little annoyance for me that has nothing to do with the stars was the tie wearing. The waiters are suppose to wear ties, but they have to stick them in their shirts so they don't flop around.

A Yelp tip said to check in for a discount, but there wasn't one when I checked in.  The guy who worked there told me to try foursquare, but that didn't work either.  After I told him I tried checking in on both, he just gave the 4 of us a 20% off discount.

We were given a coat and gloves and were led into the ice room.  It was so much smaller than I expected.  Cameras aren't allowed so there's a photographer who takes pictures if you want.  There's not too much space to sit down and basically you have a drink for the novelty of it and it's about $10 a drink.  It is kinda cool to have a drink in an ice glass.  Few things to remember though, hold your drink from the bottom, don't set it down on ice, etc.. We were bored after our drinks were done.

When you come out, everyone is looking at their pictures so it takes a while to get out.  They sell some souvenirs such as clothing but they are extremely expensive.  Also, we found the pictures to be terrible quality.

Cool 15 mins. experience, but after entrance fee and drinks, definitely not worth the price... even with a discount.",2/9/2012 4:04,36.129543,-115.188137,3355 Procyon St,NV,Las Vegas,89162,"Restaurants, Nightlife, Adult Entertainment, Cafes",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,Entertainment,Restaurants_FoodEntertainment,Jaguars Gentlemen's Cabaret

If I could I would have given this 0 stars. This was the worst show I have ever seen. I don't think he could show a more ""Yeah whatever, I don't give a f*^#!"" attitude even if he tried. 80% of the illusions weren't even illusions, they were cheap tricks half of which were off-the-shelf beginners ""magic"" that you can buy at your local magic shop and the other half simple on-the-fly computer generated overlay content that you and I can achieve within seconds on our iPhones.
Dear David Copperfield, if you think you can get away with the ENTIRE second act consisting entirely of a cheap and half-working animatronic blue alien, a tragically written (if you can even call that writing) story and a large flying drone (which is supposed to be the big wow?!), and on top of that not give a damn about any of it then you are sorely mistaken.

We all get tired, we all have better days. But it is our duty as artists, entertainers and performers to still get up there and be amazing for someone else.

It was a quick $6 cab ride from The Venetian and the restaurant was amazing!  Great food!  Great service!  Great atmosphere!  We had an awesome server (Katie?  Blonde?) who explained everything to us and was so friendly.  We had 8 people in our party and had everything from the $15ish burger to the $65 cowboy ribeye and everyone was happy.  We all agreed the cowboy was the best steak any of us had every tasted, worth every penny!  Do not pass up the roasted artichoke app!  I don't know how they cook it but it was the most fantastic thing I had ever tasted!

Some of our party spent $20 each and some spent $100, great price range!  Also, the less expensive options were still presented and cooked with the same care as the most expensive!

We wish we lived in LV so we could eat here every night!

I can't say enough great things about The Barrymore!  Try it and you will not be sorry!

I can't imagine spending several hundred dollars on a bottle of wine and at least that much on dinner just to sit at a pathetic cafeteria style tin table. For such a pricey restaurant one would think they would invest in better seating for their high paying customers. Needless to say, we declined to stay, told them no thank you and we wouldn't be back.

NO, however there were many factors that made it worth 5 stars & a HIGH RECOMMENDATION for you to try & share your experience.  From the outside you see what appears to be an upscale establishment with a combination of a butcher shop.  You walk in & to the left you will find the hostess stand & beyond that the bar with average seating but limited table seating.  To the right is just that a butcher shop which allows you to look at a variety of meats you will have a choice of upstairs or to take home.  Lets go back outside to where it says on the window, where they proudly display they serve Grass Fed beef,  Free Range Chicken,  Natural, all the key words one likes to hear.

We were greeted by the hostess who took us upstairs to the restaurant area.  As you go up the stairs you cannot help noticing the amazing chandelier & then it opens into a large marble floor area with several tables throughout & a balcony area with several tables.  The balcony was full so we elected to be seated inside.  It is kind of strange but this is Vegas, it can get loud in there like a cafeteria, but the ambiance is high quality even though you see some who respect that & others in shorts & jeans, Vegas...However, once you look at the prices, this is right up there in ambiance with the best of the best on the strip with the exception of the price, it is beyond reasonable.

Xavier the Manager came over & introduced himself as soon as we were seated, introduced himself & welcomed us.  Our server Alpheus was one of the best we have had in this town, personable, knowledgeable & takes a lot of pride in his knowledge of food which he does have.    So lets get down to food....

The menu takes a little time to cover & has a lot of choices.  If you want they will bring you a plate with all the cuts so you can make your choice that way.   We decided to start with the Arugula Salad & the Tomato, cucumber, Watermelon & Red Onion.  The Arugula which came with pear & prociutto was really good but could have used more seasoning or dressing.  It was still very fresh & good.  The Watermelon plate they use a red wine vinegar which was refreshing but it lacked the POP factor.  Adding salt made it better however some fresh balsamic would have put this dish over the top.

We decided to split the Ribeye which at $34 you wonder what you are going to get.  This Ribeye was prepared, seasoned & tasted better then anything else we have had in this town.  What we had, the quality, the taste you will normally pay upwards of $60 or more.  The ability of the butcher shop allow them to serve amazing steaks at an even more amazing price.  I have paid 3 times as much & have not enjoyed it as much as what they have here.

We also ordered Brussel Sprouts, Pistachio & Fresh Lemon, as well as Cauliflower, Chili de Arbol.  The cauliflower was amazing, the Brussel Sprouts lacked flavor.   They were not roasted & soft but had a lot of crunch to them.   The server asked our thoughts on the meal & when we shared we felt they missed the mark on the sprouts, he told us to wait & brought us a side of bacon with a bbq sauce that put the sprouts dish over the top.  This is what it was lacking.

Normally I do not do dessert however our serves felt it necessary to insist we have one on the house since they missed the mark on the sprouts.  He brought a Carmel Turtle Sunday which was out of this world.  Much appreciated but really was not necessary.

Lastly, they have an extensive wine list here but they do not charge a cork fee so if you desire to bring something in with you, they will gladly serve you.  Echo & Rig is amazing and if you have not tried them, give them a try.  If you have tried them & had a bad experience, go back & share your last experience with Xavier, he takes a LOT of pride & personal desire to ensure everyone has an amazing eperience.  You cannot please everyone but he will certainly try.

You know from the moment it arrives your in for a treat as the smell wafting up from the bowl is amazing, it tickles the senses!  Then you dive in and experience an explosion of different flavors.  In each spoonful you get a exotic mixture of coconut, fresh mushrooms lemon, cilantro, spring onions,ginger, and Thai spice. Also if you ask they will gladly add rice noodles to the soup which I definitely recommend. 

The place is not large and so on the weekend there is usually a little wait.  However during the week have never had any wait.  Also they have a take out window were you can order to go. They also have a small patio with 5 were you can sit outside and watch the flow on Fremont street which is always interesting! In addition the service each time I have visited has been very good and always friendly.  

My only word of advice when you order they ask how spicy you want it.  They offer from 0 (no spice) to 5 (Thai spice), with 3 listed as hot. Well this rating scale is accurate!

Very aesthetically pleasing, very clean, and overall, a very pleasant place to dine. Each morning there was a very short wait to be seated - no longer than 15 minutes and I should point out that this was during the weekend as well. I did notice that there were always several empty tables in a restaurant even with the slight wait. However, this really wasn't very bothersome because we were seated in a very reasonable amount of time. 
The breakfast menu, although not very extensive, has everything you would want to satisfy your breakfast cravings. One morning I tried the chocolate chunk pancakes and OMG they were divine. Thickest fluffiest pancakes I've ever had in my life. A ton of chocolate - could have even done with a little less but at least they were generous. If you are a pancake lover, please do yourself a favor and order a stack of pancakes! 
The service at Primrose was very good. Everyone was very kind and attentive. This made for an even more pleasant dining experience.

Having accidentally discovered it one morning, it quickly became hands down my favorite place to eat breakfast in all of Las Vegas. The menu is delightfully unique with an array of sweets and savories for any of your early morning cravings.

HOLY YUM. 
The Benicio is a whole other delicious beast - and if you're a meat eater and want to have the best damn breakfast of your life, order this. It is two pieces of vibrant yellow grilled cornbread, topped with moist and savory BBQ pulled pork, further topped with two eggs any way, then drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Mother. Of. God.

Now is this best sandwich I ever had? Not quite but darn it was pretty close. I ordered the La Canna which is thier take on the Italian sandwich. The biggest size was called the blunt...yes that is the name of the 12 inch sub it is called the blunt. Along with my sandwich I ordered a drink to take advantage of thier Kool Aid and oh sweet Jesus did I overdose on that magical drink! I make my way to the table and look around this place full of stickers and a mural where UNLV meets the high version of the Looney Tunes. Plus they had a bar in there too. I felt dirty eating here but in a good way. The classic rock and reggae playing here gaved this place a very unique take on a sandwich shop. 

Now for the sandwich itself. La Canna is a good sandwich with its toasted bread and yummy slices of meat. The sandwich was loaded with toppings and yet it never fell off the sandwich. The onions tasted fresh and the olives added a kick of flavor unmatched by other joints take on the Italian sandwich. It was big and I was barely able to finish it off in 20 minutes. The price was average for a sandwich joint but I it is fair to me.

Now the only big setback was that they ran out of the Goo Balls....by 1pm. I heard they are good so I missed out on them balls. They had the Goo balls to say they don't they did not have the Goo Balls! Hehehe.

My experience today was not much better than the one I wrote about then. I ended up paying $14 for a ""buffet"" , cough, cough, that was absolutely pathetic. The Tom Kha soup was ok but nothing special. 6 or 7 egg rolls would be brought out then vanish leaving an empty tray. The garlic wings looked like something left too long under the heat lamps, and then I had the Chili Mint Chicken with excessive squash or whatever the heck it was. I never thought a Thai place could massacre a dish such as Chili Mint Chicken but LOS has found a way to do it. To call this a ""buffet"" is doing the word a great disservice. I'm not expecting a spread the size of the Bacchanal buffet, but this...this is freakin ridiculous with what they're trying to pass off as a lunch buffet. 

Seriously for the price and especially on quality and taste Komol across the parking lot kicks LOS's derriere. If you think this is the best Thai food found in Vegas, you seriously need to pull out your Yelp app on your phone and do a little exploring. Coming here for a good lunch is the equivalent of a sucker's bet....pay out the nose, and get less in return. 

I can't give them anything more than 1 Star. My conscience is screaming at me for even giving them that, but fortunately Yelp says I have to give them something so that quiets my conscience a little. Now to find some Pepto to quiet my grumbling and very unhappy stomach..... 

By the way after rereading my old review...I stand by it. Still valid. And the one before that. Still valid. Notice the 1 Star pattern? Don't say I didn't try and warn ya. 

Tip: The closest place to buy Pepto is CVS which is at 2735 South Maryland Parkway, if you know the back way out of the parking lot you can get your relief in under 10 min from the turn of the car key to the swipe of your debit card.

So we pick her next favorite cuisine, Thai.  Having missed out on Pam Real Thai the last time out, I take this opportunity to make this our destination.  Walking in, it's peculiar that we are the only party there.  Turns out, we were the only party here throughout our dinner...

The interior has a clean and neat, if not exactly trendy, decor that give it a splash of style.  The server is pleasant, and as expected with us being the only guests, appropriately attentive.  Overall we were very pleased with the ambiance.  To the food that I was really looking forward to, especially given the experience the other day.

We ordered a large Tom Kha soup, spicy pineapple fried rice, shrimp pad thai, and crispy pork with chinese broccoli.  

Tom Kha soup - tasty but too salty and not spicy enough.  Was more a fan of the reddish tint to the soup, here it is white.

Fried Rice - good, fiery taste but again not spicy enough.  Also salty.

Pad Thai - Again salty but pretty good.  Has an usually tangy taste which was just okay for me, others liked  it.

Crispy Pork - Not bad, no gamey taste which is good, but taste-wise nothing spectacular.

So a bit disappointed because the food overall is a decidedly 3-star affair, but the service and the more modern ambiance gets a 1/2 star upgrade.  So really a 3.5 star experience, but the fact that it can't fully be appreciated due to the emptiness it will have to settle for a 3.

Angry Dog. Tasty. Bahn Mi dog was eh ok. Chili Cheese fries were also meh. The kim-chi had a fishy aftertaste. Am not sure if that's normal (was my first kim chi) but it was not something I'll go for again. 

But the big takeaway was this: I was MAD THIRSTY all flippin' night. In fact - I kept waking up through the night dying of thirst. So thirsty I had trouble falling asleep. 
Are we talking metric ton of MSG? Something else? I have no idea, but that's not a good sign. 

Tasty, sure, as much as any hot dog. Definitely scared off from the thirst-o-rama.

HJQHkiWaYfoj0RU39il0Rw,83hGjT-0qeA-x3wKM7X5Zw,5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw,4,14,8,7,"This is my new favorite hotel to stay while in Vegas. It's slightly higher end, it's new-er, it's trendy and now that I'm not graduate student poor, I'll splurge a little. Also, I always book through Visa Signature because you get additional perks like VIP status, $25 food and beverage credit, automatic room upgrade, etc. The best perk for Cosmo is the free breakfast at Wicked Spoon that's included, which is one of the big reasons why we stay here. Especially considering it's $35/pp for breakfast on the weekends that's like getting $70 more. You're also entitled to check in at the VIP autograph lounge where there's coffee, water, paper, and shorter lines.

Despite being not so new anymore the hotel is still ""hot"". It's trendy, a lot of people my age and slightly older stay here. Though I hate Marquee (their club) with a passion, it still seems really popular. They've got a few bars, like the chandelier and Vesper which are cool hang out spots and have great, albeit expensive drinks. It's just a ""happening"" hotel still so staying here is really convenient, you're part of the action automatically by virtue of being present. It's great for people like me who enjoy shitshows but don't want to partake. Their location is also excellent, we never had to drive once. It's across the bridge from miracle mile shops, walking distance for walgreens and earl of sandwich. We also somehow walked all the way to NYNY too for shake shack. Either way, thumbs way way up for not having to grab cabs or ubers the entire weekend. 

I've stayed in the Terrace One Bedroom and also the Terrace Studio. Obviously the bedroom is more expensive because of the Japanese soaking tub but the studio has the jet tub. Either way I find both comfortable, there's a large living area, a kitchenette, super soft king sized bed, big closets and a terrace. Their suites are pretty massive anyway so it's great to have your friends over and hang out. The mini fridge is slightly annoying because it's all rigged with temptations, like a can of coke for $6 and you can't use it to chill your own drinks unless you put it in the freezer section. There's rigged snacks and shaving kits, etc on the counter but there's also a mini bottle opener for free you can use which is thoughtful! I panicked for a moment when I tried to open my wine and had realized I didn't bring a bottle opener. Appreciate the touch! 

They've also got very nice quality robes and slippers and C.O. Bigelow toiletries! Usually shampoo/conditioner from a hotel is total crap but theirs is actually decent. The rooms and hallways show wear and tear but they've done a decent job of covering it up. I imagine in a few years they'll need to redo carpeting and give the place a fresh coat of paint. Also, Cosmo is super clean and reminded me a little of my private undergraduate university, people are cleaning ALL THE TIME. It's ridiculous, you can see people cleaning 24/7, everywhere. There are many people who work very hard to maintain the hotel so be nice to them!!! Tip generously. Aside from this the casinos are also one of the cleanest ever, somehow the cigarette smoke is absorbed and dispelled elsewhere so you don't stink of cigarettes while you walk around. 

Parking is free which is great and may no longer be a perk we can enjoy in vegas much more, staff are courteous and nice. I wish they were a bit more clear on the perks for booking through visa signature. I've done this twice and each time they forget to tack on the $25 food/bev credit so I always have to go down to the check out desk. Either way, I always have a good time here and it's really appropriate for where I am in my life now that I don't want to get dressed up, wait 20 minutes in cold for cab, get ripped off, get in line for 40 minutes to get into some dumb club. I'd rather have one nice $16 drink than a bunch of Fat Tuesdays, this is the hot yuppie hotel for me! 

Also Yelp just reminded me by asking ""good for kids"" the answer is NO. Vegas as a city unless you're doing something wholesome like seeing the hoover dam or grand canyon is NOT good for children. My friends saw a couple with a damn STROLLER at 11PM at night in the elevators here. A drunken person almost ran into their stroller/baby and it's vegas, can you REALLY blame the person for being drunk in sin city or the irresponsible parents who are keeping their infant out past 11pm? Ugh, just think through what you're doing parents.

One FINAL thought, I HATE the bathroom walls. I've posted a picture and you can see it's black wallpaper with a repeating silhouette of conjoined girls dancing or something and when you're hungover or puking it's THE WORST. It makes me dizzy when I'm sober so when you're drunk? *shudders* Just No.",2/2/2016 5:25,36.13170799,-115.1913887,"3111 S Valley View Blvd, Ste I-101",NV,Las Vegas,89102,"Greek, Restaurants, Sandwiches, Pizza",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Apollo's Pizza

The restaurant is along the walkway in the food court area of the Grand Canal Shops.  Given that, the dining is likely to be noisy because there is a lot of foot traffic going by.  That's also fun because you get to watch tourists as they walk by some wondering where the hell they are and where are they going.

I had a reservation for 5 PM and the restaurant was almost empty.  Within fifteen minutes, it was somewhat crowded as people filed in.  I was brought water and iced tea.  Warm bread soon followed the beverages.  I asked the person who took the order if it was possible to get a half order of the frito misto and the answer was no.  It's always a share dish so I passed on that and got the Caesar salad instead.  For the main course, I ordered the fettuccine Casanova.  

When the Caesar salad came, the server ground fresh pepper to my taste.  The salad was a standard, good tasting Caesar with a good amount of cheese and some croutons, one of which was like a rock.

The fettuccine was very good.  Grated cheese was added to my taste.  There are mushrooms, bacon, chicken, cherry tomatoes, and some arugula in the pasta that has a light cream sauce.  I took my time with the pasta enjoying the flavors while watching the people go by.

For dessert, I got an affogato.  The espresso was very rich and the ice cream and coffee went together nicely.

Service was good.  The tables are close together.  I was OK for awhile because to my right was a small aisle for the servers and to my left was a wall.  Later, a family came in, and when they were seated, I could have eaten off the plate of the man right on the other side of the wall.  It was interesting listening to their conversation.  If you come here with someone else and care if people mind what you may say, don't speak in a normal voice.  Keep it low.

Altogether, a pleasant dinner with Strip pricing which I knew before I went.",7/23/2016 20:20,36.0417267,-115.1839224,3333 Blue Diamond Rd,NV,Las Vegas,89139,"Breakfast & Brunch, Arts & Entertainment, Restaurants, Casinos, Pop-Up Restaurants",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,Entertainment,Restaurants_FoodEntertainment,Meals with a Mermaid

Writing that out, it seems a bit demanding, but that is what I expect from the Jose brand.

This review is not about how bad they are but the fact that they don't really specialize on anything else but Porches and I think they need to call that out. Todd did ask me to pay for an hours worth of diagnosis but couldn't tell me a single thing that was either isolated to not be an issue or the issue itself. I was ready to pay that but get some info out of it, and when I started questioning about what could be the issue he just flat out said 'I will waive the fee, but I need the car gone out of place today'. It was quite rude how he wrapped up that conversation but I guess I understood his frustration at not being able to give any info.

Am sure these guys are good at what they do but a bit of humility and true focus on the customer will go a long ways believe.",11/1/2015 18:00,36.10266711,-115.1735733,3790 Las Vegas Blvd S,NV,Las Vegas,89136,"Fast Food, Food, Seafood, Restaurants",Restaurants,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Fulton Fish Frye

2013 was a 3 star festival, but 2014 completely blew it out of the water and was 4.5 stars
The festival was expanded from 2 days to three, the  layout was different and the music was a lot more diverse. 
LIB is a lifestyle festival in the sense that it's not just about the music, but the art, food and people are just as important. Everywhere you went there was some sort of reminder to smile and the beauty of life. I've been to lots of festivals in my life and this had some of the best energy in the sense that there weren't any obnoxious or frat bros types that always appear at fests in varying amounts
The music was also miles better than last year. I love the killers and imagine dragons as much as anyone else but the 2013 lineup was mostly a college rock vibe. This year the extra day helped minimize the conflicts that define most major festivals. The lineup was strong from top to bottom, and anywhere I can go from the roots, then foo fighters, then skrillex is my type of party
--also, dancetronauts were one of my favorite art cars at burning man, so seeing them get their own stage to just go wild was one of my highlights and I seriously seriously hope it's there next year
The biggest and most impactful change was the layout. For example last year all of Fremont east was inside the festival so if I wanted to go to Le Thai or commonwealth is still have to deal with festival crowds and couldn't enjoy downtown if I wasn't part of it. This year the outside businesses were on their own and they added to the experience. Every night when LIB was done me and my friends would just keep the party going by bar hopping
It also helped that container park was open this year because it made it easier to showcase the chefs. Last year it was a clusterf**k trying to see the chefs and enjoy everything else. 
Also, I absolutely loved in and out privileges. There are several reasons why you might need to step out of the fest but the ability to do so is so valued!!

-the negatives weren't much, but I'd say the biggest one was the learning sessions. I loved them, but I only was able to make it into one because the learning village area was small. I'd love for them to find some way to expand it. I hated having to miss out because it was always at capacity. 
Me and none of my group were thrilled about paying for the Ferris wheel. Most fests don't charge and it made us want to ride less. 
This isn't one that I out on the organizers, but if you were drinking your way thru the fest like me you would notice that some bartenders had heavier hands than others 

Overall, this was a 4.5 star festival. And I'm even more excited for 2015 based on the giant leap it took from last year to this

When checking into rental I very politely declined all added services that car rentals typically try to add on at time of check in. First off car itself was dirty and stained, but oh well you get what you pay for and I didn't need anything fancy.  I accept blame that I did not read throughly all paperwork we have to initial. However, I had made myself very clear that I was not interested in any add ons and trusted him not to try and scam me! As he was having me initial on the machine the agreements he never mentioned any of the car collision or Roadside assistance that I was being charged for!!!!   I had thought I was initialing to decline these add ons....arghhhh.   So I didn't even pay attention to paperwork until I returned the car and got email receipt with the extra $ amount charged. Call to Advantage did not help except to put in a dispute and to wait for them to decide if they will refund me the money. DO NOT RENT from ADVANTAGE ever!!

The 911 and Haley rolls for $4 and $5 respectively are tasty and priced right during happy hour, but for some reason, I can never get full on them. The new happy hour is more focused on the sushi rolls. The non-sushi items are edamame, spicy chicken (fried), shishito peppers (very delicious) and gyoza. I am not sure I understand this change because with numerous AYCE late night options it seems that you could really stand out by discounting more of your non-sushi items.

Only 3 of us did all you can eat and he rushed us to decide right away even though it was our first and last time ever going there. As my brother was ordering his all you can eat he stops him and tells him ""he can start with that and order the rest later"" which was ridiculous! How can you only order 4 rolls then be told you can't order more if you're having all you can eat?? After that the guys attitude got worse from there. I made it a point to say thank you after he came to drop off anything and he just looked at us every time as if we were a problem for him.. I've been working in the service industry for 6+ years and I've never been one to complain about bad service let alone yelp about it but this guy was really just a piece of work. Then he tried to add 18% auto gratuity to our bill and extra sodas which then I was done being nice and made him take off the extra stuff and auto gratuity. Then he didn't even bother to bring us back our bill and gave it to his assistant to bring it back to you and just kept shaking his head.

He did have a very sweet server assistant that was very kind and kept  apologizing for him and I asked her to speak to the manager and he listened to us but didn't seem to care and didn't apologize for his servers behavior but based on the reviews I'm sure this isn't the guys first complaint. So in the end we got the gratuity taken off and made sure by the manager that when we give the very nice server assistant the tip and not our server that she wouldn't have to share it with him. We tipped her over 20% because she was wonderful.

The food was definitely delicious, however, the miscommunication from management, and the food preparation deserved a one star. The server was polite, considerate, and diligent. I'm not giving a one star because she was great! Some of the complications regarding the food are bad seafood and undercooked blobs of noodles. 

The birthday girl ordered a seafood chow mein which was bad and got it replaced for chicken. My issue is that the chicken chow mein was ringed up like a seafood chow mein (the seafood cost more than the chicken). Aside from that, my lo mein was cooked in blobs or chunks and had an odd taste. I got it replaced and it was delicious but there was still chucks of noodles (not as many and as big as the first one). We did not receive any compensation or discounts for the misunderstanding and bad seafood on their behalf. 

One major factor that played a huge part in this review is that I told the server about a member of my party's birthday and received a nice cheesecake but not singing. Might not sound like a big deal but there was another birthday and I heard some servers singing happy birthday to them.

I know, I know, there's an app for that, but sometimes I throw caution to the wind and just go for it.

I called them up for a take out order and decided on the Regular Chicken Kabob Entree and an iced tea.  I must mention that from taking my order over the phone to doing the cashier work, the gentleman who helped me was extremely friendly.  After my long drive back to the office and opening the food, I was extremely disappointed to not see any bread.  Upon looking back at the menu, I realized that it was not something which came with the entree, but rather a side that needed to be ordered.  After bashing my head against the desk for about 5 minutes due to this error, I began eating what I did have, which were some nicely cooked pieces of chicken (though not very much of it) over a HEAP of basmati rice.  On the side were several chopped up onions, and an unappetizing looking charred tomato and pepper.  I'm generally not a fan of these items from any mediterranean joint, so not docking them for that, maybe it's just me.  The chicken tasted fine, but didnt really separate itself from other places I've had the same dish.   I think I would have preferred some more char on the chicken instead of on the veggies, but it did end up very juicy which I must say was nice.   The rice tasted average to me, though I did appreciate the amount they gave.  I can't help but think that had I ordered some bread on the side (though I'd prefer it just came with some) that I might have enjoyed the whole thing more.  I definitely know for next time.

For the lack of bread with the entree, and the fact that there wasn't too much chicken in my meal, I can't say that I thought it was that great of a value.  Zaytoon definitely requires some more investigating to me, and I'll also note that my friend that I brought with me got a falafel sandwich with fries and his fries smelled and looked heavenly.  He polished them off during the drive back to work and I didnt get to try myself.

3Iy7-7_DQkF-XHTrKmwa7g,2Q-voEsSwNbO_Ph0ffyzLQ,4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,1,1,0,0,"Yelp, this is my first review, and Hooters, you should have seen this coming. I walked down here all the way from the Wynn, which was a journey in itself, just for the cheap beer and wings (which we all love).

So I get there, empty bar, but no service to be found. I wait five minutes, and finally the bartender acknowledges me and I get an overpriced bud light. But that's the least of my worries...

The real reason I came there was to get some wings. So I went to the restaurant, and there were two hostesses who seemed more than annoyed with my presence (like who is going to seat him / where are we going to seat him, when the restaurant was more than half empty). 

But again, that wasn't my problem... After 15 mins of sitting there, and knowing the whole time what I wanted to order (recall that I had that whole time walking there to contemplate life) I finally went to the bartender, told him I'd been there forever, and said I'd like to order. The bartender looked at me like I was an idiot, and accused me of seating myself. So that tassel went on for a while, and we finally resolved that issue after he went to the kitchen to yell at the only people who were actually doing their job. (Side note, the bartender was actually really nice / doing his job too, and an innocent victim in all this).

The real problem was the waitress who showed up twenty minutes after the fact. She instigated that I was going to order and run without paying. Wtf, what is it against brown people and this restaurant? Well after this argument, and me presumably winning, she finally took my complicated order of ten regular wings. Another fifteen minutes went by...and at this point I thought I'd make a simple request for water (I guess they had expected me to eat dinner dry).

End of story, I had my wings an hour later (which were great, don't get me wrong). But, what the heck was up with the service? Between the two hostesses seeming annoyed to seat me (why the f it takes two to seat one person to begin with, I don't  know), and then an hour to order one plate of regular wings (and having to put in the leg work myself), I regret my hour long Harold/Kumar-esque journey 

And I wouldn't remember the waitresses name, except when she all of a sudden became attentive after handing me the check. At that point, she made sure to show up three times in the span of minutes. Thanks Franki

Oh!!!! And I forgot!! So the staff actually felt bad and apologized, and gave me an order of fries with my wings. But Franki then came moments later, and said ""you didn't order this,"" and took the wings.

My friend and I ordered waters and she got a soda, but the server went on and on about the margaritas for what seemed like a few minutes when we had already established that neither of us was going to be drinking.

My friend ordered the tortilla soup and when they brought it out there was no spoon, so she politely asked for one.

The price of the food was as expected for being on the Las Vegas Strip. But $9 for some guacamole? Beat it! I should have brought my own avocados.

There were a few good things, which is why I gave them two stars.  But the screwups were so bad, and even when the management was made aware of them and didn't really compensate us for it that I'm almost tempted to give them just one star for being so shitty.

So we came here because we were catching the Muse show just down the hall at Mandalay Bay Events Center.  We had a restaurant.com certificate we wanted to use, and we had seen Susan Feniger on Top Chef Masters perform very well and thought that would translate into a good meal at her restaurant.

We ordered the following:
Sangria Margaritas - was too sweet but ok
Queso Fundido - was good but didn't like all the guac all over the place, and not enough cheese to call it a queso dish.
Watercress, Avocado, and Orange Salad - loved this salad, nice and refreshing
Fish Tacos - see below, these were awful
Grilled Skirt Steak - one of the highlights of the meal

I want to specifically highlight that even though we ordered the queso fundido, the waiter did not actually order this dish for us, and accidentally ordered the beef sopes.  When we told the waiter there was a mistake and did not order the sopes, the waiter apologized profusely and said the manager of the restaurant was going to talk to us, insinuating that the restaurant would comp us for having to have us wait for them to make new appetizers.  She came up to us and apologized and said they were going to hurry with the fundido, but no comp.  We weren't sure why she bothered apologizing since the waiter did already.

Once we finally got our main courses, I had ordered the fish tacos which I had heard were some of the best in town.  I took a bite and they were stinky, fishy smelling, and bland.  I hated it.  I inspected the dish more and the fish did not seem to even be properly cooked, and the fact that it smelled made me question how fresh the fish was.  There was also supposed to be a crema on the tacos, but there was no crema here.  This dish was so bad, I actually complained to the waiter and the manager at how awful it was.  The manager actually tried to argue with me that the dish was fine.  Eventually, she took the dish and said they were going to remake it, but I didn't really want a remade dish, I just wanted to send it back and not get another because it was so bad.  However, they remade it, charged me for it anyhow. I had lost my appetite from the experience but took a bite to be polite, and it was better but I was too scared to put a good dent in it, thinking they were going to try to kill me with bad fish.  I took the rest to go and threw it away. 

Anyway, we'll probably never go here again unless Susan Feniger herself calls and apologizes for such a crappy meal.",4/12/2010 10:58,36.12630649,-115.2416607,"6850 Spring Mountain Rd, Ste F-6",NV,Las Vegas,89146,"Korean, Restaurants",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Woori House

Initially, we came here for Karaoke, but after reading all the reviews raving about the food, we thought we'd kill 2 birds with one stone and get some dinner as well. Also, my husband was craving some Korean fried chicken anyway so why not.

So, can't really complain about the karaoke aspect here. Decent selection of songs. The book is massive, but like 75% of the songs are Korean, so if you are into Kpop or here to sing in Korean, you have found the perfect place. It also has a decent selection of English and Japanese songs. 

The food is where I become torn. It was mediocre at best. We ordered original KFC and bulgogi fries. The chicken was, like, ROCK SOLID. I know KFC is typically super crunchy, but crunchy and hard are not the same. Subsequently, the chicken was hella dry. My husband liked it, but I was not here for it. Skip. The bulgogi fries as well were, like, ALMOST good. It was essentially nachos on fries though, I didn't feel anything ""Korean"" about it. Just some onions, tomatos, mayo, and ground beef on french fries. Okay? I mean, it wasn't bad I guess. I wouldn't order it again though. 

That being said, we had a fantastic time here. We spent around 2 hours here + the food and it came out to $65. I'd say thats a pretty good deal. I WOULD recommend coming here for Karaoke and drinks, and even some food as a group.

When we were to be seated, the hostess tried to sit us right opposite the open kitchen, which is brightly lit, noisy, steamy and certainly not where we wanted to be. She then went back to see where else we sit and we got a table for 2 in the bar. The food was good. Foccacia was warm and they offered oil and vinegar as well as butter. We found the service was fast, maybe a bit too fast.  Maybe Saturday night is a busy one,and they try to move their diners along. We had the beef medallion, $38, cooked a little too rare for medium, but it was tasty. The mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach that it was placed on, could have been a bit more generous. Very skimpy on those portions. We also had the price fixed dinner for $38, which gave you choices. We had: Grandma's meatballs, chicken parm with spaghetti and they were tasty but they skimped on the sauce so although it was good, it could have been better. The chicken parm was very crispy and tender but the spaghetti was a bit dry. The meatballs had a nice portion of sauce served with them, so we should have kept that dish, just for the leftover sauce. The desserts you could choose was a cannoli or a Nutella cake with salted carmel ice cream.  Nah...didn't appeal to us, but we were told you couldn't substitute from that menu.  Really?  I can understand the entrees but the desserts? We were told that they had a 'full dessert menu' but our waitress never offered to show it to us. Carlo's Bakery is right across the hall from the restaurant, but by the time our meal was done, so were we. There was quite a long line waiting to get into the bakery, and it wasn't moving very quickly.  What we did notice, was that when you go to sit at the bar, there are 2 steps up, and there is no handrail in the middle of this wide expanse. We saw two patrons stumble, and one of the waiters actually took a flat out fall. We may go back to give Buddy V's another try and since we now know the lay of the land, so to speak, we will be specific about where we want to be seated, and will order with a request for ""additional sauce on the side"".

What a joke.  I'm out of state so that doesn't even include sales tax.  ""New bike fees"" increase the price of the bike by over 30% or $1,815.  It's a classic bait and switch tactic.

On the manufacturer's website you will see on all listings that dealers have the say in what the final price will be.

They have TONS of toys and yes, tons of vintage.  I don't know why some people are claiming they don't have very many vintage toys.  I can't say too much about the prices - I have no idea what action figures run these days, but as far as diecast cars - there is a full wall of Hot Wheels that are relatively current that you can find at Toys R Us and Wal-Mart for a third of the price here.  Their large diecast (the 1:24 and 1:18 scales) do seem a bit high.  They run anywhere from $40 to $125.

The reason I only give it three stars?  I went in recently to ask about a specific line of toys.  As it happened, Johnny was in the store and I talked to him.  He said they had a bunch of the line come in recently but it was still all boxed up in the back.  He had the person behind the counter take my name and number.  A month later... no word from them.  So I went in the other day and Johnny happened to be in again.  I asked him if they ever got to those toys.  He pretty much blew me off.  It didn't seem to me like he was that interested in selling (and I would have easily bought $100 dollars worth right then).  I'm not impressed.

I'll stick to finding the toys on ebay where they are plentiful.  It just would have been nice to actually look at them in person before buying.

X6AsSNrlX5LTOiG7DrGdQA,wfi0T-xq_P5sKQvwQitlYg,DfgZlNgKwBvCpA_0alumXw,1,19,11,5,"A true sense of customer service is how a business handles things when the customer isn't happy with their experience and what they do behind the scenes and not what they appear to be doing.  I won't go into all the details of my experience of what led me to complain (but you can read Jeff G's review if you want to read the details) but it's how The Mirage responded.

There were lots of inconsistencies and lack of communication due to a charges for 'using' the minibar refrigerator.  Yes, there may have been a sign on the fridge door but if it's not clear on the on the price list, one may assume they want people to move things around and use the fridge for personal use and then be charged, which is the assumption I make.  Also they couldn't answer when I asked why my sister's fridge was locked and why ours wasn't so there seems to be some inconsistent practices.  Ok, so maybe I don't know the rules of Vegas to know ""Do not use the minibar if you aren't going to consume anything from it"" but all the other times I stayed in Vegas there's either been no minibar fridge or I stay in a resort with a kitchen so I can load up the fridge with whatever I want and move things around for FREE! Maybe it would be good to assume not everyone know this Vegas rule.

The sense of this being a large resort, and I am just one guest of thousands who has an issue is the feel of this operation.  It's not like exceptional service on cruise ships, nor am I expecting it to be but the condescending manner the Manager at the front desk spoke to me was unprofessional in a customer service position.  When I inquired with the front desk agent about the charges, she informed me it's due to a sensor and since I moved items I would be charged for consumption of them.  When I spoke with the Manager, he said he would remove the charges but I would be charged a restocking fee.  He did his eye rolling, you are annoying me, I don't get paid enough to deal with this, look and I wasn't going to argue with him anymore.  He also blamed marketing for not being clear on communicating the fridge is not for personal use.  Way to pass the buck.

When I asked who else I could communicate with, I was told they would give me an email address to send to.  After the interaction, I wasn't provided with an email address and had to ask for one.  They don't really want people to email and complain, do they? Shortly after our one night stay, I received an email survey from Mr. Kallao, VP Hotel Operations, which I'm sure is sent out to all guests.  When I didn't reply right away to the survey, I received an email reminder a few days later.  So this means, Mr. Kallao REALLY wants to hear what I have to say now and will actually do something about it? 

So I completed the survey and also looked up Mr. Kallao's email address as he took the time to email me, I thought I would take the time to email him as well.  I forwarded him the email that I sent Lori P, who seems to reply to most of the Yelp reviews, and waited for a response.  But Lori P nor Mr. Kallao responded but I received a response by someone who signed their name Guest Experience.  They tell you it's going to take 3-4 days to get an email response (mine was quicker than that) but wonder why that was as they seem to reply to online reviews in a shorter time period?!  And wow, what a name to work in guest services and be named Guest Experience! Lori, when you read this review, no need to write a response as Guest was able to help me. 

They replied they would call me and I provided my contact number and received the call.  The person on the other end of the line, I don't recall the name but it wasn't 'Guest Experience' who called (must have been Guest's day off), quickly agreed with me the situation wasn't handled well and that I would be receiving a refund on my credit card.  She must be trained to get on and off the phone in less than 2 minutes and give unhappy customers' their money back.  

At the end, I'm happy to get my money back.  But don't be fooled. all the glitz and glamour to make you feel like a valued guest are just for show, once you have an issue they will want you to disappear just like the tiger show they had.  Also, for the price some guests pay here, you can stay at another resort where you can actually use the fridge for free!

The first time that me and my fiancee went here, we got two of the specialty boba drinks, both off of their ""favorites"" listed on the wall. 

Anyone familiar with boba knows the difference between normal, fresh boba & boba that's started to break down because it's been sitting too long. Our boba balls seemed to be the latter. 

My fiance's milk tea had a somewhat soapy flavor, and he didn't even finish it.

We chalked it up to a bad day at the restaurant. We gave the place another shot a few weeks later.

We tried to play it safe this time by just getting Thai tea with boba, and while it was okay, it was definitely some sort of pre-mix. There was no color differentiation from liquid creamer, so I suspect it was powdered creamer. You could taste something was off. 

While we were sitting waiting for our tea, we saw a sign that said free Thai tea with order of crab ragoons (or something small like that, I don't remember specifically). It would have been much cheaper for us to order that way, as the food item was a few dollars less than a Thai tea by itself was, but our cashier said nothing about this deal when we were ordering.

2. Counter person said they would call when the car was ready. It's now been 3 hours and no call. Not surprising.
3. The counter person said if you're a local renter, you're limited to 150 miles. We we're renting for 5 days. Not mentioned on their site. Hidden fee/exclusion #1.
4. Counter person said that if you're not a local renter then it's an additional $100. Hidden fee #2.
5. Counter person said that if you use your own insurance you need to have the insurance declarations, not your insurance card. Hidden exclusion #3.

h8j2QqJlR3kh2rB-Nqvy2Q,ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,3Gt3xskppi9jZuTrwrhLNg,2,3,0,2,"Las Vegas is all about change. Favorites come and go. Some remain solid and by the time they bid farewell we are left saddened. Then, there are others that were once good, but those days have come and gone. I'm sad to say this happened with Stack at Mirage. Eight years ago it opened with Brian Massie at the helm. The space was beautiful, service was exceptional and the food was everything good ole American comfort food should be, and the playful twists made it fun. Over the years, we've dined at Stack more than any other fine dining restaurant. We loved the relaxed vibe, the stacked waitresses and the classic tunes. The hot rocks, pork chop and lamb shank were outstanding. The bacon cheddar bread? Oh my goodness, we couldn't get enough. We'd return for that alone. 

Over time, they no longer offered the bread. The classic rock was replaced by club beats and the prices climbed while quality sank. We noticed a decline about a year ago, and it was confirmed a few months back when we took my husband's cousin out for her birthday. My brother joined us, too, he was eager to try the lamb shank he's heard so much about. I even called beforehand to confirm it was still be served. You can imagine our disappointment when we couldn't locate it on the menu. We waived down our waiter and sure enough, it's been eliminated. This was likely the sign to leave, but we ignored it. We've always been pleased with the steak selection and everyone but me opted to go that route. I chose the halibut ($42). 

We started with hot rocks ($21) they were still excellent. The Spicy Crab ($21) was a new item and it didn't pack any punch. It left us pretty underwhelmed. 

We've enjoyed the porterhouse for two at Brand. We expected the same quality here at Stack but it fell a bit flat ($96). It was plenty for two to share, but it wasn't as flavorful or tender as we know it could be. We also shared tater tots ($11) and roasted mushrooms ($9). The tots used to have pieces of rich smoky bacon and cheese would ooze when you'd bite into eat tot. That's not the case anymore. 

This was my brother's first fine dining experience. he went all out and ordered the porterhouse ($62). I wish I could say he was able to reap the perks and find the value of a quality piece of meat. It was very average at best. He was disappointed and I was bummed for him.

My halibut was the best dish of the evening, the exception being the hot rocks. The halibut was nicely prepared with a hard sear and it was very fresh.

After finishing that meal, the warm comforting mahogany walls suddenly felt somber. A longtime favorite had faded. We knew we wouldn't be back. We suspect it would soon shutter. I didn't see it surviving long after the opening of Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak. I haven't heard any news of it closing, but I certainly wouldn't be surprised if it did.",10/4/2013 5:19,36.081692,-115.211842,5165 W Oquendo Rd,NV,Las Vegas,89118,"Food, Specialty Food, Event Planning & Services, Food Delivery Services, Health Markets, Personal Chefs",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Pure Fit Meal Prep

I was fortunate enough to tool around late one night/early one morning with a friend I met at a bachelorette party in Vegas. At the time, the mall was only 9 days old. The mall doors were open 24 hours but the stores closed around midnight.

The night staff was pretty special, too. We came across one attendant who was about my dad's age and really nice about informing me that no alcohol was allowed inside the premises when I walked in with a beer in hand (Hey, remember, this was Vegas - where carrying around an open container of booze was the norm). He even took the time to chat us up about the new mall, its hours, when construction was completed, what everything was, how certain details of the mall were constructed, and even a bit about his family. And yes, he totally pulled out wallet portraits of his beautiful daughters. Such a sweet man. ;) He also walked us over to the glowing ice sculptures on the first floor, gave us a quick science brief about how they kept them frozen and encouraged us to touch them! I felt like a kid in a candy store, there was so much to see.

However, the only reason I can't give Crystals 5 stars is the fact that it is an over-glorified South Coast.

rxfFgbdtwuyNBj1isqbn0Q,vkA1X3TxQfTKMNRvCBEKOA,AYe8rS3qBPuLHSwNOZSbcA,1,2,0,0,I would give this establishment ZERO stars if I could. Came in at 9pm to a completely empty restaurant. Ordered a pellegrino which was dropped off and not poured. After pouring my own water I consulted the singular menu given to my party. Had to ask for another menu. The paper menu for sushi selections was soiled with soy sauce. I asked the busser for another one and she ran away resulting of my most awkward restaurant experiences of all time. I inquired about this bizarre behavior with my server who informed me the employee spoke zero English. At this point due to the nonexistent professionalism and lack of cleanliness I decided I wasn't interested in eating anything that came out of the kitchen. I asked my server to get a manager and as soon as she heard the word manager she suddenly forgot how to speak English as well. At this point my only option was to pay 8$ cash for my water as sushi Loca has a 20$ credit minimum and none of their employees are communicable. I walk out to my car and as I'm googling another restaurant to go to the aforementioned selective English speaker server walks out and gets in her own car. I have worked in the service industry for years and believe we received appalling service so that we could leave and said server would get cut and be able to go home.

Wow. 

It takes like 5 minutes to walk the length of the ""U"" shaped Aria buffet, which is good, because your buffet-eating ass should get a small walk in while you're perusing the buffet-offerings. 

But then, Oh...em...gee....the buffet has everything. We did breakfast there, but you'd never know it with all of the lunch offerings. Everything from a bagel and cream cheese bar to an omelette bar, an Asian-inspired bar, crab legs, shrimp, traditional breakfast offerings, a Tex-Mex section and every conceivable pastry. 

And although $17.95 is kinda of a lot, it's not a lot for a Vegas buffet, comparably speaking. And if you like crab legs, well that's your money's worth right there.

Couple years ago I went there and got a couple pairs of pants and the person that measured me for alterations did something wrong or the person that altered them did something wrong and I got a pair of flood pants. Which I then ended up taking to another place to have it altered and made into shorts. So these are now two of the most expensive shorts I've ever purchased in my life.

The latest incident is something that I ordered online to be shipped to the sunset store a pair of shoes which I swear I ordered in Gray. When I checked the status on my order it shows the order in Black. When I called to ask about it they said gray was not available and they weren't able to change it or cancel the order. So they tell me I'm going to have to wait for the order to get to the store just so I can refund it there. The problem is I ordered it two days ago and it's still being processed it hasn't even shipped yet. So the lady on the phone tells me that if I wanted to upgrade to expedited shipping... Right there I had to interrupt her because I told her it hadn't even shipped yet! I know what the hell expedited shipping means.

They seemed a little disorganized, but I'm not sure if this is common or an anomaly.  

They don't have ombre sample nails, so Maya asked me to find one online to replicate.  I had one on my phone and she tried to mirror my example.  The outcome was not the same, but I still liked the look.  

The only issue I'm having is that a few nails have what feels like granules on them and I can't stop messing with them.  I wish they were smooth, but these don't affect the look.

****UPDATE****
8/12- owner freaked out. All went silence. Nothing was retrieved. This was to be expected. 

The owner reached out to me today trying to have this fixed. We hope there is a resolution for this issue 7/16 
*****************************************************
My husband and I went to this pizza joint on Sunday July 15th 2018 at around 2pm. My husband recently earned some money and we came here to celebrate with our 6 month old baby. We were greeted by this server- Dylan who seemed very nice and sweet with my son. He sat us at a table nearby the kitchen. When we asked for our check Dylan nicely brought the check over however it was the wrong check for the amount of $50 something ( it was a different orders for someone else). My husband asked Dylan for our correct check and a short while later he came back with the correct one with our orders. We paid and left. 


However when we left we forgot to take the bag of money with us. We came back later and my husband spoke to the manager Chris who said Dylan had left his shift. He called Dylan asking if he saw the bag and Dylan denied ever seeing it. My husband came back today Jul 16th in hope of retrieving our money but everyone denied of seeing it and there's no cameras in the restaurant. It was a big sum of money and we are so disappointed that the their none conscience has gotten the better of them. It is our fault to forget the money but we are sure someone has stolen it and wouldn't give it back. The money was enough to split couple ways among the manager/server/ and whoever else on that shift. 

This is just a warning for those who's thinking of visiting the restaurant. I can say the food isn't too bad but shady service and business.",7/16/2018 18:40,36.239068,-115.167814,1811 W Craig Rd,NV,North Las Vegas,89032,"Mexican, Restaurants, Fast Food",Restaurants,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Del Taco

I had a line of credit with the casino. The first time I came down, I asked the cage how should I pay and they said to mail them a check. I mailed them a check for $3,000 which they cashed but they also automatically drafted another $3,000. This caused my checking account to bounce causing all sorts of problems and fees. After much effort, the casino finally agreed not to charge me the extra fees for the returned check but would not repay me for all the fees I was charged on my end by my bank. I sent an email to corporate but received no reply.

Fast forward a few months, I decide to give PH another chance. I book a room and proceed to the casino. I go to a table only to find out that my line of credit has been cancelled due to my check bouncing last time. Of course I did not bring any cash to gamble so I had to take money out of my credit card incurring over $100 in fees. I complained to my host and to collections why I was not notified that my line of credit was cancelled. I ask them if I can get any kind of credit for all the fees I was charged. They tell me to pound sand. I will never gamble at PH ever again despite the really awesome gambling atmosphere.

They picked us up promptly at the hotel, and got us to the range quickly.  When I made the reservation, they said that they would have us on the range by 12PM.  Well, that's not exactly how it turned out, as we didn't actually get on the range until an hour after we got there.  So basically you just have to hang out in the waiting room.  We had been waiting a while, and I asked them if there was anyway they could move things along since I was getting married later that day, and obviously I had some other things to worry about once we were finished there.  They didn't seem to concerned about any of my potential time constraints.  

I had made a reservation to do the 3 gun pkg and fire the automatic shotgun.  That cost me somewhere around $230.  Which obviously is pretty expensive for the equivalent of 160 rounds.  So then while we're sitting there, I was informed that I needed to go ahead and pay my $35 tip.  I wasn't aware that there was going to be a mandatory tip before we even stepped into the range.  They should call it something other than a tip if it's mandatory.

Well, once our group finally got in the range we started shooting guns.  We had 2 instructors and were working on 2 lanes.  It took a long time to cycle through all our group and their guns.  Typically it was approximately 10 minutes between shooters.  The instructors were friendly enough.  Shooting the guns was great, and it was a fun experience that I'll remember for a long time.

Obviously I was planning on giving my new bride the MGV thong that was part of the package.  They were out of them.  Also, we had to remind them that we were owed free t-shirts.

In the end it took 9 people 3.5 hours from pickup to dropoff.  Which is a long time considering that you only spend about a total of 4 minutes shooting.  Having said that, it was a good experience.  Just as long as you know that it will take a while and it is expensive, and there's a mandatory tip.",7/17/2012 2:10,36.11578596,-115.17323,3570 S Las Vegas Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Restaurants, American (New), Breakfast & Brunch, Burgers",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen

One night last week, I wanted a quick bite so I used Open Table to find somewhere close by that I had not yet visited. I came across Annie's which really caught my eye. After a little poking around I discovered they had a great happy hour which included 1/2 price appetizers and some drink specials ($2 off wine). 

As I entered, I was blinded from the Las Vegas sun so it took a minute for my eyes to adjust to the dimly lit setting. The friendly host asked where I wanted to sit, I asked the bar since I was by myself. I was a little confused since I didn't see any bar.  She proceeds to the back of the room where she opens a hidden door into the small, intimate bar they called The Lost Weekend. 

I was greeted by a very nice bartender who was very quick to greet me and prompt to get my order. I went with the sampler or ""trio"" which included fried calamari, mozzarella sticks, and friend ravioli. This was more then enough food to make it an entree. I was absolutely stuffed to the gills when I left! Everything was pretty good! I would like to return to try their homemade meatball scampi appetizer, everyone was ranting and raving about it.

The hostess is perfectly mannered and checks to make sure you are having a good time. The server is very friendly and does her job well. And the chef, is smack in the center of the place cooking up delicious food for its patrons.

The decor? Preps you for dessert! Everything just reminds you of chocolate chocolate chocolate! Mostly dark brown hues complemented by lighter beige. The room itself is a big circle with the chef in the middle and the table laid out on the edges. There is a crazy swirly cream booth that runs the outside edge of the room that is plush and high backed. The light fixtures look like chocolate swirls with elongated glass ornaments hanging from them.

The best one I've ever ever had! Not just even slightly better, 10 times better than all the other ones! The bread was toasted to perfection, somehow they worked it so that it was flaky on the edges (perhaps some toasted cheese). Everything worked really well together from the egg in the middle to the cheese they melted on top and then of course the super toasty bread that I just loved. There was salad on the side too.

Eggs Benedict served on a croissant
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw?select=VTDmXd1AdVBLlo31ow1Uyg
When they first put the plate in front of me, my first thought was that they had over toasted the croissant! But then, as I dug into the rich hollandaise sauce with the perfectly poached egg I understood why. They definitely were not light with the sauce and combined with the egg, it needed the crunchy toasted croissant to offset some of that richness. Plus if it wasn't toasted enough it would've become just a very smushy croissant instead. So delicious...but so rich. Order this...but make sure to switch plates halfway as the amount of egg yolk and butter will put you in a food coma for the rest of the day.

Macarons
I was a bit disappointed that these were already packaged up and not sold individually, but oh well. Yummy nonetheless. These were made with the cookie being very light and the jam not extremely sticky. Neither was it chewy, just melt in your mouth. So light that if you bit into one, the whole thing didn't just crumble away but held together. The flavors they had in the 5 pack I believe were chocolate, coffee, strawberry, raisin, and lemon. All very good with the flavors being very natural and non artificial tasting.

Chocolates

Had to try these of course right? He is known for this stuff...and rightly so. The chocolate shell is made so that when you bite into each piece it doesn't just crack away but goes with the filling. And each piece had so much clear flavor for such little bites. My faves were the rocher noir and the truffles.The rocher noir was dark chocolate and wafers. Oof...I could eat a whole bag of these, very very addicting. Light and fluffy yet crunchy at the same time. The truffles...melt melt in your mouth!!!

I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in Vegas. Oh...don't forget to check out the macaron tree in the front display too!

I had several problems that I recently cancelled my membership (well it's gonna be once they return my call) First, I signed up for membership @ the Lossee location in Vegas & I loved the gym there but then moved to California & then started to go to the Redondo Beach location. I couldn't use my membership because it's franchised so I had to sign up again. Pre paid for 3 months & per the sales rep that signed me up said that she faxed the paperwork to the Lossee location so that it'll stop my monthly automatic payments to the membership of the Lossee location.
 I recently noticed my bank statements & saw that the Lossee membership was still been taking out of my account so I've paid for 2 gyms when only using one. By the time I noticed it, I was already newly moved back to Vegas. I get the run arounds from the Redondo Beach location when I called them. Very fraustrated by that, I decided to cancel both mines & my husbands Lossee membership. Went online to see whats the procedures to cancel & it said to go to a Golds Gym because you can't cancel online or on the phone. The next day I keyed in Golds Gym on my gps thats near my home & it gave me the Sahara location. Got to the address & there were NO Golds Gym. A lil fraustrated but still determined to cancel my membership, I then proceeded to the Lake Mead location in Summerlin. Walked in & told the employee that I wanted to cancel my membership & then she tells me, ""oh you have to call this toll free # to cancel it"". I'm then pissed because the website said to go in one of the locations to cancel. I just wasted my gas in my vehicle & time when I could've done it in the comfort of my home.

The last two times I've visited, the check-out lanes were pretty sparse. Everyone's probably over a few doors down at Seafood City still, but it's nice to know there are other options if you prefer to avoid the crowds. Open since October, I'm obviously late and just now hopping on this new train. Choo-choo, all aboard to Maryland Pkwy and Katie Ave!

Perusing the aisles, everything was well organized. On my last visit, there was a young man doing a floor sweep even though the floor was pretty much immaculate. I enjoyed browsing the variety of Asian goodies (though its competitor still carries a lot more Filipino items). Teas galore! Frozen foods! Packaged snacks! Some evoked nostalgia: White Rabbit candies! I ended up trying a box of Uji Matcha milk tea, which smelled like a green tea kit kat when prepped. Yum!

The food court is what I look forward to most -- there's Bread Farm Bakery, with its visually stunning display of cakes and pastries (most of the pick-it-yourself batch is less than $2) and also the Ihaw Ihaw, which seems to be connected to Asian Kitchen. They offer a double combo for $5.99 which includes 2 items, rice or noodles, soup, and a drink. I recommend their tofu w/fish dish! Their milk tea with tapioca is surprisingly decent with soft boba, too. And only $1.99! There's also a Vietnamese place, but I haven't had the chance to try their food.

Overall, great shopping experience.

IeYcigdvbzb7i8c9fRovEg,paqwgbEh_iJ0Y1zjM0ed1A,6NG_A-epYEpsJSugfAaTRQ,5,1,0,1,"This event is CRAZY!!!! This was our first time going and it was an overwhelming experience. Stimulation overload!! Estimated 135,000 people per night, for 3 nights in a row of hard partying. Lights, lasers, fire, shooting water, fog machines, performers, fireworks, whatever else you can think of...EVERYWHERE! Gates open at 7:00 pm and it goes until about 5:30 am every night. 

I'll try to keep my review short since a lot of other people have already said all the great things about EDC. 

- I would advise taking the shuttle! We took JusCollege from Downtown and it made life ALOT easier for us. We never waited in line too long (max was probably 15-30 minutes, even during peak hours). You just sit, relax, and let the driver do the work. They do their best to cut through traffic, find dedicated shuttle lanes, and just use any shortcuts they can to get you there the fastest. The longest it ever took to get to the festival was 1.5 hours and shortest was 45 minutes. Coming back took 30-45 minutes. I can pretty much guarantee that if you drive your own car, it'll take you twice as long...if not longer! Plus, you have to do the work of driving, run the risk of getting into an accident, fight your way out of the parking lot when exiting, etc. I dunno about the other shuttle services, but JusCollege was ON POINT! Worth every penny! 

- Even if you go during peak hours, the lines to get in are not that bad. At most, I think we waited about 30 minutes to get in. Try to get into lines with the least amount of guys because they tend to search guys more thoroughly than girls, so it takes longer. (Not much to search on girls...they're usually just wearing bikinis)   

- I would spend the first day learning the layout of EDC. It's a huge place with LOTS of stuff to see and do. Learn where the bathrooms are placed. Learn where the water refill stations are placed. Learn how to get to the different stages. It can get confusing if you don't get your sense of direction down. 

-  Bring one of those folding hand fans. It's HOT, and those things will save your life...and help you make friends. 

-  Bring a little flash light of some kind. Those porta-potties are dark!

- Bring cash! Most of the food/drink vendors only take cash. If you forget to bring cash, they have ATMs around. 

- Stuff is expensive, so be prepared. A can of beer (low-end domestic beer) is $9. A cocktail is $14. Little cheeseburger is $7. Single slice of pizza is $7. Bottle of water is $5 (use the free water refill stations!). Small smoothie is $10. Soda is $6. Most of the food is carnival type food, but there are some food trucks spread throughout. 

 - Use the water refill stations! They're free and they'll fill anything up! Don't be afraid of the lines. The most we ever had to wait was about 5 minutes. Just don't try to fill up when a huge headliner is starting or just ended. The crowd will be huge. 

- Pace yourself. Remember, you have 3 full nights of partying. Don't burn yourself out by night 2. There are a lot of great acts that go on night 3. 

- If you plan on staying until it shuts down on the last day, be aware that not only will you be fighting all the traffic leaving the festival, but you'll also be fighting Monday morning commuter traffic...so it will be very bad!

- Be very cautious if you're going to buy a ticket from a scalper. Apparently, there were thousands of people who were turned away because they bought a wristband (ticket) from someone that was actually a legit ticket. Then the seller reported it as lost or stolen, so Insomniac issued them a new one and deactivated the one they just sold..leaving the buyer screwed. 

- It's hot, so dress accordingly. Around 110-120 degrees in the daytime and 95-105 at night. It gets hotter when you're in a crowd of people jumping around!

- If you're planning on fitting in a bunch of rides, good luck! We had hoped to ride a bunch of rides and only got to ride 2 rides in all 3 nights. The lines just get way too long and I didn't pay $400 to wait in line all night for some carnival rides. 

- Although it's nice to buy the Insomniac bottle so you can bring it in and refill it, I think a small camelbak would work better. It was kind of a pain in the ass to hold that big bottle everywhere we went.

Even all the hosts on the bus were great! One even started dancing on the pole in front of us and Ocean jumped in! 
The reason why it's just one star short of 5 is because the bus ride was super short. Wish we spent more time on it.

They are made with cheap wonton wrappers and they claim to be made with shrimp and pork, but trust me you can't taste or see any of these ingredients. The noodles were alright but too plain for the price- also the menu listed the noodles as ""sweet potato noodles"" but they were cellophane noodles. The chicken was a teriyaki katsu cutlet drenched in a thin translucent lemon sauce that you could easily make at home or buy at a teriyaki restaurant for a quarter of the price. Also every dish on the menu desperately needs RICE! But they don't offer it unless you ask (pay extra).

My food took over 30 minutes to come out.  The Garlic Short Ribs were luke warm, like they had been sitting there under the warmer.  They were crisp and the flavor good.  

The egg roll was also room temperature.  There was no dipping sauce.  I would have liked a side of sweet and sour sauce with the egg roll.

The server never checked on me until I asked her for the check.  I would have liked a spicy tray and a water refill.

I also ordered some food to go.  The Angel Wings were very bland and tough served with a tiny container of sweet and sour sauce.  I would not order them again (King and I has the best Angel Wings in town).

The Chicken Curry was served in a flat container with a lid rather than a soup container.  The curry leaked and made a mess.

This was just one bad experience.  I like most of their food and will be back to dine in.",8/28/2013 20:39,36.02066323,-115.0889233,2300 Paseo Verde Pkwy,NV,Henderson,89052,"Pretzels, Food",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Auntie Anne's

We chose the garden as our ceremony location and it was absolutely breath taking. The view of the lake made our experience very intimate. We chose to have our reception in the swan garden, the room was absolutely gorgeous! Lucas was extremely helpful with all the planning as well as all the questions I had. Denise made sure that my night was perfect! Everything went extremely smooth/organized the night of the wedding with very little stress which was nice considering I was extremely nervous. Denise, Lucas and staff made my dreams become a reality. The ceremony location and the reception venue was exactly how I pictured it for my special day. They followed every little detail I wanted and more considering I did a lot of DIY projects for this day. All my family and friends kept bragging about how beautiful the place was as well as how fun the wedding was. The DJ and the Minister were amazing! The minister made our ceremony so beautiful. The DJ made our wedding so much fun and played all the right music! Everyone kept saying that is was the best wedding they have ever been to! The cake was delicious, we chose vanilla with a strawberry filling. Other than that my whole experience was absolutely amazing definitely exceeded all of my expectations!

I thought MGM would be great as it is well established but the customer service is as bad as it could be! When we booked with expedia, we were told that we would get complimentary buffets. We confirmed with the front desk staff when we checked in and she explicitly said we (4 people) get to have buffet for free twice within the hotel and all the fees would just be waived when we check out. Thus, we stayed within the hotel for two DISGUSTING meals just to save money. When we checked out, we were charged for the buffets (they waived the fee of 2 buffets ie $80). When we inquired about it, the front desk person first accused us of lying saying we did ""mobile checkin"", which we did not even know was a thing and we also said they could check the surveillance camera for proof. Then he finally got the manager to talk to us. He was as bad of a manager as you could possibly imagine as he basically told us to suck it up and pay. This is MGM we are talking about, not some random motel! He not only was not understanding at all, he also said we just have to be responsible for our own expenses and since we bought it through expedia, they can't do anything about it, and we have to be responsible for their OWN EMPLOYEE'S MISTAKE!

The restaurant itself is not large, and is open to the casino, so it lacks that intimate, restaurant feel. The decor is bright and colorful and the light fixtures (a bunch of bananas!) are inventive and pretty. A mixed salad with Greek olives, feta cheese, chickpeas, and a zesty dressing is brought out and served; no sumptuous salad bar you berate yourself for filling up on! The bread is little round pillows of cheesy goodness. A chimichurri sauce on the table was outstanding. Then come the meats, served to you on long sabers from which your portions are cut....The Rodizio dinner includes all the meats except filet, and no seafood. We had lamb (delicious!), sirloin (yum!), pork with grilled pineapple (kind of dry), bacon-wrapped turkey roulades (also dry), marinated chicken drumsticks (a little hard). But all you need are two or three you find delicious and they'll keep them coming. The meat server remembered how each of us liked our meats and that my daughter did not want red meat, she was great. There is also garlic bread chunks on a saber, large bread squares slathered in chimichurri and grilled.....amazing.

The chicken broth was perfect - not too powerful/salty. The egg was done perfectly, and as other reviews mentioned, the pork is torched in front of you and was delicious as well. I really enjoyed the in-house made noodles. 

The service was excellent. We were checked on frequently. Food was brought out within 5 minutes of ordering. Vegetarians, have no fear. My friend is a vegetarian and initially opted for the rice bowl and requested it without the meat when he discovered that all ramen options were meat based. When the chef discovered this, he instead asked if my friend would be open to trying his variation of a vegetarian ramen. From what I could tell, there was extra bamboo, seaweed, and a few other ingredients. Hopefully they'll add this dish to the menu eventually because my friend said it was delicious, but be sure to mention it if you'd like a vegetarian option.

I admit, I was so spent after the session that I was barely awake by the time we were done. Then I hear the words ""baby, I'm taking you to paradise tonight"".  Well, that's one way to wake me up with the quickness. Only obvious with what I was thinking.  But moted I was. The gurlpren meant she's taking me to Paradise Boba Tea and Smoothie for our post workout treat.  Hah...good trick to boost my energy and it worked.  

Paradise is a family owned business that sells boba, milk teas, smoothies, and even some food.  I didn't even know this place existed, but it's here.  Here in Summerlin tucked in the shopping center across from 24hr Fitness.  The owners here are so nice and even threw some compliments our way. And who doesn't love compliments?  Well anyways, I had their Mocha & Peanut Butter Smoothie w/Boba. The combination of mocha and peanut butter meant a really sweet treat.  I thought it was also too thick, but that should be expected, especially with the flavors I chose.  The boba was warm and silky smooth, which only enhanced the smoothie.  Overall, not bad at all and for an additional cost, you can even have whey protein added to it. But I didn't stop there. I had to try their spam masubi.  The spam masubi was a little small, but still packed a punch with flavor.  In other words, I wasn't disappointed with it.  

I'm giving Paradise 4 stars for location, service, and taste.

To top it off, the drinks here were great! Smoothie drinks with shots of 180 octane for only $8... you can choose from flavors including Strawberry Lemonade. We each got a drink and took over a whole area with couch pillows and waterside views... and with more alcohol comes more rowdiness than a whole day club could handle.

I originally wrote part of this review for ASHLEYS TOWING INC., but then I realized a HUGE part of the problem is that Desert Shadows has a contract with this towing company and is basically authorizing the towing of it's residents vehicles on PRIVATE PROPERTY in exchange for a KICKBACK. Desert Shadows will nickel-and-dime you, and it is especially sad that they are willing to allow their own tenants to be towed in an effort to make an extra buck. RENTER BEWARE.

My car was towed while it was parked in front of my own apartment in a gated private community, DESERT SHODOWS,  at 3am for having expired tags. Mind you I had already renewed my registration and was just waiting for the stickers in the mail. Ashley's Towing Company of Las Vegas did this. They charged me almost $400 for a car that they had for under 24 hours that was legally registered and parked. They were super rude and offensive when I tried to retrieve my car, and I'm positive that they overcharged me because I asked questions. 

The girl in the office ""Shelby"" (she had multiple lip piercings and ling black hair) tried to charge me an additional fee on the sly. I actually almost swiped my card until I realized what was going on.....then I hit cancel on the credit card machine.  When I asked her what the charge was for, she told me it was a ""late fee"" for ""after-hours pick-up."" Apparently she forgot that she had told me over the phone that there would be no after-hours late fee if the car had valid registration. I mentioned this to her, and she subsequently became very aggressive and rude,  took my credit card, and told me that she would take me to my car to find the registration, and then she would charge me the late fee anyways. On my bill, the late fee was described as a ""Night -Fee."" I asked her if that was because they towed my car at 3am and she gave a vague and confusing answer. I had a friend with me who witnessed the entire thing. Basically, I was charged the extra fee she tried to swindle me with in the first place. 

This business and its practices, especially this kind of intimidation and towing should be illegal, and is basically bordering on theft. I wouldn't be surprised if the apartment complexes that use ASHLEY'S TOWING INC. are receiving kickbacks in this ridiculous and unethical SCAM. (By the way, the apartment complex where my car was towed from is DESERT SHADOWS).  

I looked up ASHLEY's TOWING INC. on the internet and spoke with the police department. Apparently this company is notorious for this. I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, the Nevada Transportation Authority, and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. Per the LVPD's recommendation, there will also be a civil suit filed.

Make sure you are aware of your community's ""relationships"" with these types of companies, and read the fine print! ASHLEY'S TOWING INC. is DECEITFUL and CRIMINAL at best, and DESERT SHADOWS is none the more innocent for participating in this SCAM. It will only be a matter of time until their UNETHICAL practices come back to haunt them.  If I could give NEGATIVE Stars, I would.  I hope no one else as had to go through this, ....BUT IF YOU HAVE, PLEASE REPLY AND LET ME KNOW YOUR EXPERIENCE!!! (I will be happy if this helps even just 1 person). 
Thanks.

Husband and I had dropped the ball making reservations for dinner on a Friday night.  Nothing looked available on Opentable.  Thank goodness for the concierge at the Encore.  She recommended Sinatra (which I knew Nothing about) and called up and made us a reservation within 10 minutes.

When it comes to restaurants in Vegas, my expectations are low.  I find places loud, crowded, gaudy, overpriced & overhyped.  

As we approached the restaurant, located in the Encore, we saw photos & awards of Frank.  (They need photos of Frank & Ava; they looked damn good together.)

We were immediately greeted and taken to a quiet intimate table.  There were people, but they were far away.  Privacy at a Vegas restaurant?  Spectacular.  The decor made one nostalgic for the Vegas Rat Pack days.  There are giant photos of Frank and they had his music playing (yes, I'm a fan and have his greatest hits on my iTunes).  Its simple, yet elegant.

Then, I don't know if the host was the manager, but he stayed and chit chatted with us for about 10 minutes.  Between the decor, music & personable host, we were relaxed and in quite the amorous mood.  

A bottle of Chianti-Very Good
Caprese-thought this was standard but was really craving it
Insalatina Dell Imperatore-they do Caesar salad right w/anchovy 
Ossobuco My Way-Very Good (but a big portion and couldn't even come close to finishing)

Was it pricey?  Of course, its Vegas.  BUT, it was worth every penny (a rare statement by me in Vegas).

I was having a Bobbie; she wanted me to pick up Turkey and Provolone, lettuce - no onions, no tomato, no oil and vinegar, no salt and pepper. She's almost a complete vegetarian; never eats red meat.

When we opened the sandwiches at home, mine was correct. Hers was labeled as an Italian sandwich on the receipt (with provolone specified). It was chock full of nothing but red meat... including pepperoni, ham, and one other. She was ticked off and decided to head over to exchange or return the sandwich for refund.

The manager, on the register, was the same person who took my order. She insisted that's what I ordered. My girlfriend's response... ""I didn't sent some flunky to pick up a sandwich, he knows me more than 10 years. He knows I don't eat red meat and would never order it for me. A refund ensued.

The manager made a parting dig. ""You got your refund, you should be happy.""

Not really... a simple sandwich order had been made. Deferring lunch at that point was not a 'happy moment'.

The room delivered where it needed to: being clean, well laid out, and free of any unpleasant odors. Most of our time wasn't spent there (because Vegas), but we had a good time while in the room.

They start you off with their french bread. The bread itself was delicious and the butter was creamy. They also have this carrot spread that tasted good. Their selection of wines was extensive, but I went with a simple cocktail drink. 

If you love cheese and onions then their french onion soup is a must! The soup was not too salty and the melted cheese mixed well with the onions. It's a large serving, but I make it dissappear in seconds! On to the main course...the steak! I chose the boned in ribeye!

Paris was my ""must see"", so I planned for our group to have dinner there and then go to the top of the Eiffel Tower to watch the Bellagio fountains.

Several weeks before our trip, I called La Village to make a reservation since we were a large group, I thought it might be nice to give them warning we'd be coming. The morning of the day we planned to go, we had a lot of things go wrong and we got behind on time so I called to let them know and was told we didn't have a reservation in the first place.

When we arrived, and finally got to the front of the line, the hostess was noticeably irritated about our party size (which actually was smaller than planned, only six of us ended up going), and she tried to talk us into splitting our group into multiple tables. 

The atmosphere inside the restaurant was beautiful. It was everything I had hoped for. The food was alright, not as much selection as other buffets, but they did have a crepe station which made my 12 year old son happy. Service left something to be desired. We had to flag our waitress down twice to get refills.

After dinner, we all met up at the Eiffel Tower experience to purchase our tickets. As soon as our group was done getting tickets and taking pictures, we got in line and were immediately told the tower was closed for rain and lightning. 

This is understandable, you can't control the weather. We were told we could wait in line though, as they may be able to reopen within half an hour. So we went and got souvenir cups while waiting, then most of the group split off to play some slots while my husband and son waited in line.

About 10 minutes later, a security guard approached my husband and son and told them that minors under 21 aren't allowed to gamble, and that ""he should be at home in bed anyway"". 

Well he wasn't gambling, he was waiting in line for an attraction. When my husband explained this to him, he was told that no one my son knows can gamble while he is in the building, and threatened us with heavy fines. I didn't want to cause anyone any problems, so I cashed out my slot machine ticket, and the security guard came over to tell me that since my son was in the building, I wouldn't be allowed to redeem it for money.

Another person in our party was kind enough to redeem the ticket for me, and we decided to get refunds for the Eiffel Tower experience and just leave.

When we went outside, we were surprised to find that it was dry and totally clear outside. Not even a cloud in the sky. As we waited outside, we watched the elevator continue operation to the top of the tower.

At that point we decided to just go back to the Stratosphere and go to their observation deck. When we got there, we talked to one of the employees there about what had just happened, and he told us there was a lightning warning earlier in the day, 50 miles away and moving away, but that it had expired several hours earlier.

I am so frustrated by this whole experience. We encountered nothing but grace and hospitality all week in Las Vegas, and we fell in love with the city and the people. We certainly won't allow Paris to take anything away from what was ultimately a magical experience, but my husband and I spent over $5,000 between just us, not counting the rest of our wedding party. We plan to return to Las Vegas at least once a year to celebrate our anniversary, and at this point I can't see any reason to bring any of that money back to Paris.",4/10/2018 3:26,36.11899784,-115.1703831,3475 Las Vegas Blvd S,NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Restaurants, American (Traditional), Arts & Entertainment, Music Venues, Bars, Nightlife, Southern, Burgers",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,Entertainment,Restaurants_FoodEntertainment,Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill

A group of about 20 people (farewell dinner) decided to eat here last minute. We figured we would just eat in the bar area, which wouldn't require a reservation. Everyone was extremely shocked by the price of all of the food. Heck, even the appetizers averaged at about $15. The margaritas were average with an above average price. The blended had large chunks of ice, on the rocks margaritas you could taste the triple sec (quite a few others in the party and myself are bartenders/servers) The server in the bar area, Ericka, wasn't TOO terrible until the end. Towards the end of the end of the night, someone asked for their check so they could leave. At that point Ericka said she wasn't splitting the check, but that she would bring out the entire group's check at that time. Someone mentioned that to me so I asked for Ericka to come and explain to me what was going on. She told me what she told the other person, that she was not splitting the check. Upon my constant asking of why this was, she then tried to say that she had talked to the first table there (the parents of the bride and groom) and that I was not there for the conversation, so I had no idea. 

So after Ericka walked away, I went to ask the parents what she had asked or said at the beginning of the night. They told me that Ericka had asked how we were doing everything, and they told her a couple different times that it was all going to be split. So when Ericka came back out, and I asked her what exactly the first table had said. That's when her story changed and she said that they told her we were going to split the checks. So I asked her why we were not splitting them, and she responded with asking how I expected her to do such a thing. (I feel even someone with no food and beverage experience would know what to do to split checks among any size group) So when I said she could have written everything down according to check numbers in accordance to the guests eating/drinking each item, she tried ignoring me. After a few seconds go by of my looking at her with no response, she asked how to do that, and with my best efforts not to sound pampas or rude, I told her she could have written it all down. At that moment she laughed in my face and walked away. I requested a manager and was approached by one several minutes later. She apologized for the situation we were in, but then started questioning why we were there without a reservation, or without calling her ahead of time. (She claimed to be the events manager for the restaurant). I told her it was last minute and did not think a call or reservation was needed to sit in the bar area. She apologized one more time and said if we ever wanted to do a party or large dinner again to be sure to call and set it up with her. When she started walking away I said I wanted to talk to her about her server, Ericka. After explaining what happened, she said she would talk to her later on about it. In my opinion, she seemed to be brushing it off. 

So after the manager leaves, I see Ericka just standing near the bar, not really doing much of anything. So I walk up to her asking what the plan was. She looked at me blankly and then asked if she was going to come figure out the checks so we could all leave. This is the point in the night that I was completely dumbfounded. She told me no, and then said that I could do it. After waiting a little bit for the shock to wear off of what she just said, I asked for some paper, and proceeded to go around the entire table, asking each person/couple what they got to eat and drink. I even wrote check numbers along with their names. So I go give her the paper, offer for any more assistance and she says no, and I go sit down. Several minutes go by and she walks up to me, hands me all of the split checks, says, ""Here you go."", and walks away. Not only did I split the checks for her, she then expected me to pass them all out. to speed up the process I did so, just so we could pay and get out of there. 

I have never in my life been treated so horribly by any sort of restaurant, not even fast food, and that says something. I will encourage everyone to NOT visit this place, unless you was mediocre food and beverages, and a ridiculous price.",12/8/2015 6:24,36.2611004,-115.1841219,3275 W Ann Rd,NV,North Las Vegas,89031,"Restaurants, Filipino",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Kusina Ni Lorraine

#NAME?,QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJww,H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg,4,4,2,4,"I had bookmarked a few places I wanted to check out in Vegas before my trip and Jean Philippe was on the top of my list. 

I almost screamed with joy when walking into the bakery. Everything was perfect. From the pastries, the chocolates, the baked goods, and even the gelato looked pretty. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=jZqViN77-gIVUxT62EFE9w&userid=QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJww
Although I would have liked to try a crepe I had already bought an Earls Sandwich and was just looking for a dessert to bring on the plane..... 

There are many pastry options whether you are a chocolate person, a fruit person, a custard person, they have it all. They even had extravagant macaroons. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VOFgHdstzzjhi3S1gq38dQ&userid=QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJww  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=IQmkc5uyqdw6THBDerkyvw&userid=QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJwwThe prices on the pastries is where unfortunately Jean Philippe loses a star in my book. Close to $7 for a pastry is ridiculous. I don't care how good it is - and yes it was good but not $7 good. I have eaten perfect pastries similar to this in Japan and even those aren't $7.  

I was eyeing the Napolean but it looked like it had a little too much custard cream so I went with the fruit tart. It was beautifully deorated with raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, slices of apples, kiwis, and pineapple and some mandarin oranges. I know that Jean Philippe aims for quality over quantity and I completely respect that but the tart part seemed a little thin. This was my only complaint as the fruit was perfectly ripened and the custard cream wasn't overly sweet. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJww

I also grabbed a croissant which was $4 which was a better value than the skinny tart. It was buttery, flaky and oh so good with some homemade strawberry jam the next morning. 

Would I come back? Yes, of course 
Would I get the tart again? Probably not. 

I love bakeries especially high quality ones..and I know it in Vegas but I just wish their pastries were a LITTLE bit more affordable. I could have bought 2 Earls sandwiches with the price I paid for the tart and the croissant.

I've seen Afrojack and Deadmau5 spin at EBC and it's always been a good time. They get the best EDM DJ's in the world here(just like Marquee Day Club), so if you like pool parties and EDM this is the place to be. They have DJ's such as Tiesto, Avicii, Deadmau5, Afrojack, Steve Angello, Calvin Harris, Deniz Koyu...

Entry:
I can't stress this enough: Buy presale tickets online! If you know you are going to go beforehand, just do it. It'll save you lots of $$, about 50% off what you would pay at the door. You'll save lots of time waiting in line as well. The one time we didn't buy online presale tix, we had to wait in a super long line to get in the day of and it took forever. After waiting for over an hour and not moving very much we decided to do what you always do if you don't want to wait: Grease the bouncers. So we greased him a Benjamin and we finally got to the front where we then had to pay the full price which was something like $125 each. Ridiculous! If we had bought our tix online it would have been like $60. You can bring in a backpack but you can't bring in any outside food or drink and they inspect it very thoroughly. You cannot bring in eye drops or any medication. You will need to check it in at the front and then go back to get it if you need it. 

Environment:
Unlike Marquee Day Club, there is plenty of space to find an area to sit either on the edge of the pool or on the side by one of the planters. The capacity of EBC is probably 3 times the size of Marquee Day Club, so it seems much more relaxed. Be warned, the music is very loud because they have speakers surrounding the entire pool which is actually quite impressive. I think I counted something like 80 speakers surrounding the pool all along the walls. Because of this there isn't really any place you can go where the music is not loud, so if you need a break from the noise you'll need to leave the pool or bring ear plugs. Since the pool is so large, you can easily find a place to take a quick dip on either side or in the middle in front of the DJ.  There is an area to dance in front of the DJ as well. 

Food/Drink:
Drinks are ridiculously expensive which is expected at any Vegas club, almost $20 per drink after tax and tip. However food is actually pretty good here, and costs much less than alcohol! The chicken sandwich/wrap is what I order every single time. They also sell soda, powerade, water, and beer at the food window. The line usually moves much faster than the line at the bar, so if you just want a beer or soda or water, this is a good place to go. 

One complaint about this place... the security is not very good, but as expected they probably are just temporary workers, not permanent. One time I was drinking my powerade and a head of security lady came up to me and told me I wasn't allowed to bring in outside food or drink and told me to throw it away. As you can imagine I was very confused since I had paid like $5 for it at the food window! So I argue with her for a little while and she still doesn't believe me so then my friends have to come and back me up and tell her that I really bought it at the food window, along with beer, water etc. Obviously she did not know what drinks they actually sold at the food window so she finally gave up and believed us. 

EBC sets the standard for how all other pool parties in Vegas should be, which is why I gave it 5 stars. People who give it four stars are just complaining about the service or price of drinks, but wtf do they expect? And where else is there a better pool party in Vegas? Marquee is the only other pool party that compares because they get all the popular DJ's too, and all the really hot model girls go there. But Marquee is way smaller, super cramped and crowded and the drinks cost just as much.",8/20/2012 21:47,36.12853124,-115.1988249,3380 Arville St,NV,Las Vegas,89102,"Pizza, Restaurants",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Boss Pizza

The parking is free and there is a nightly resort fee of about $40 which gets you wifi in your room, access to the gym, etc. WiFi speeds were fantastic, able to stream Netflix without the drops we've experienced in many other hotels and resorts. Decor is very clean and new and staff is always super friendly. The Grand Canal Shoppes between Palazzo and Venetian offer many places to eat good food within close proximity to your suite. There are multiple pools (family, 21+, etc) to choose from and the noise level from the rooms is very very quiet if any at all (one of the quietest we've experienced to where we had to put on our white noise machine to sleep since it was too quiet and we are used to the sound of fans lol).

The Seina Suite: very roomie one bedroom two bathroom luxury suite. One bathroom is a powder room and the main bathroom has a sunken tub with jets, a TV, and a shower with 5 different shower experiences. The TV's are smaller than in the regular studio style luxury suite, and because this room is bigger you don't get as much natural lighting from the windows, but overall a really amazing and beautiful room.

The luxury suite (base suite, king bed): one of the biggest studio style hotel rooms I've been in. Great natural lighting and roomy. Bathroom has sunk in tub (no jets) and tv and shower like the Siena suite. TVs are much larger, and decor and everything was very clean and neat.

Both rooms have electronic sheer Roman shades and blackout curtains, a bar fridge (filled with the stuff you can buy, not for you to use to put your own stuff in), plenty of storage including closets and drawers, and a means to save electricity via the master switch when you enter. Beds are in the middle of soft and firm so not super soft or super firm and multiple types of pillows for your comfort.

Overall our favorite place to stay on the strip, however there are a couple casinos we haven't stayed at.",6/8/2017 18:05,36.0928631,-115.2085074,5335 S Decatur Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89118,"Mexican, Restaurants, Fast Food",Restaurants,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Roberto's Taco Shop

The space is beautiful and intimate, with an urban feel. The food is affordable and well executed with the same passion and precision that Chada Thai is known for.

You'll be hard pressed to find a better chicken satay ($7) in town then the tender, well seasoned version here. It's also a great dish if you have a kid who's a picky eater with you. If you're sensitive to spice, you may want to avoid the spicy herb sausage Sai oua ($8). There were some great flavors there, but it was too spicy for my palate. The crab curry ($12) was more restrained with its spice, yet displayed plenty of depth and smokiness. Shredded bits of crab could be found throughout and pouring it over the rice noodles made for a great combination.

The small portions made it possible to sample plenty of other dishes. The stir fried cabbage ($7) was simple and satisfying. Crispy chunks of cabbage were mixed with bacon. It was a mild dish that was a nice contrast to previous dishes. My two favorite dishes were the fried pork belly ($7) and lab moo ($8, ground pork, chili, onion, lime). I'm a sucker for anything with pork belly and the deep fried strips were crispy with enough fat to enhance the flavor and keep the meat tender. 

Rounding out the meal was an excellent dish of crab fried rice ($12) large enough to share and full of crab and egg throughout. The chicken pad Thai ($9) was equally as good. It's a well known classic and they did it justice here.

The biggest drawback about Chada Street is the parking. Especially on a weekend, it can be tough to find an open spot. You may have to circle the lot several times or park behind the building, but the effort will be worth it.",5/26/2016 5:31,36.168245,-115.13913,611 Fremont St,NV,Las Vegas,89101,"Cuban, Restaurants, Mexican",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Mamacita's Restaurant

Of course we had to try every restaurant here as well. 

Over the years this was one of our favorite Mexican restaurants and have come in just to eat here.

When you are seated to start they bring you salsa and bean dip with chips, these both have to be the best in town, and they never mind refilling them for you and believe me you can make a meal just out of these! 

I always love the Chicken fajitas. They are so good here.Just the taste and flavor are better than other places we have tried.  My husband gets the beef burritos. He loves how big they are and always gets extra sauce on his. 
When our Son has been with us he orders the fish tacos they are really good .

Service has always been pretty good. Always seated right away and food is consistent.
We did have a favorite waiter who was always on top of everything but he went to another casino further away. The margaritas are good too.

but....we went on a Friday night with a group of 13 for a surprise 40th birthday. We got the private back room which was great, and the waitress was ok. The problem started after our meal. The waitress brought out a bill for 13 people, we all sat next to our significant other and thought she had been paying attention to the orders but the bill came and she refused to separate it. To make it even worse we were only then informed that they can only take 3 credit cards and the rest had to be cash. We were all from Canada and don't carry that much cash as we spent around 125$ each. 
We asked to speak to the Manager as there were 6 couples and 1 single that needed to pay and most needed cards. They wouldn't accept this and said there was nothing they could do about separating the bills. After 20 minutes of arguing with management one of our group members divided the bill into each member's total for their incompetent staff. We then had to figure out how to pay. After dealing with this absurd rule we eventually just told management we can only pay with credit for the most part and each group was separated. After sensing the frustration they reluctantly allowed more than 3 people to pay with credit. 
When paying the waitress said to one of our group members, ""you university students must not eat at restaurants like this much"" and that ""you just don't know how its done"". First of all, after refusing to separate bills a waitress is not likely a mathematician and the room had multiple doctors and university lecturers. No students.

It is usually customary to inform the guests that there is an automatic 20% gratuity with groups, We realized this after closely examining our bills but she was sure fishing for an extra tip. I am always happy to pay for good service, but this was an absolute nightmare. 

So needless to say all our other meals at ""nice"" restaurants started off with asking the wait staff, can we get separate bills and can we each pay with credit cards? To which the staff looked dumbfounded and replied: ""yes of course, why?""

For a much better experience go to Toa or anywhere else.

I have made sure to tell everyone I know going to Vegas to avoid Joe's. I'm sure it would be great for couples, but a group of any size should avoid it at all costs.

My husband and I have been living in our home 10 years this July and slowly our power bill has kept creeping up during all seasons not just in the summer. Average per month $488.  That's almost $6000 a year! In the winter time our power bill was around $275 and in summer time around $600. Our house is 3417 sq ft and there is only two of us. We have consulted our neighbors with similar square footage and their power bills were not even close to ours.  So instead of waiting for our two ac units to breakdown and be at the mercy of ac companies during the +110 degree weather to either fix or replace them we decided to take control. My husband contacted and met with 5 companies and 4 solar energy companies. He explained the same problem the exact same way to each company without influencing them in any way.  Each solar company indicated our main power cost is coming from non efficient AC units.  The ac companies varied in pricing from $12000-$40000 with each a different recommendation for type of unit. 

Richard the owner of this company definitely stood out from the rest. First off he was the only owner who met with my husband all others were sales reps. Secondly not only did he met with my husband but set another appointment to meet with me. In addition he provided a solution to our problem rather than just selling us two ac units.  Turns out our venting system was done incorrectly which was creating our hot spots in our home as well as the in efficient units. The other companies did not address this at all. One company even suggested that our units were fine and should last a few more years.  

Richard and his team provided us with a honest and fair quote, arrived on time and finished on time.  Which is rare for companies in Las Vegas. It's been a month and the weather has not been over 82 degrees and we have already saved $100 compared to last year. We feel that Richard took the time to provide us with not only a solution but educated us on why his recommendation would help. He also provided us with three solutions rather than trying to steer us to just one. He gave us the control but also gave us the guidance to understand our options.

cpxD9Yxtv_xu8lf-q38dJA,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw,3,5,1,1,"The day after a superb dinner at Guy Savoy (getting in later than my friends who were in Vegas to ""party"" and still waking up before them) I woke up early - feeling great I went for a run outside, the first time I'd ever done so in Vegas - what they say about it being ""a dry heat"" is right and the mornings are dry and cool - running from the Venetian down to Mandalay Bay and back I was more dehydrated than I normally am on a run twice the distance.  Drinking plenty of water and showering I'd worked up quite an appetite and made my way out for another walk south on the strip - this time to Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.  Arriving at 7:20am I was greeted by the friendly hostesses at the door and led promptly to a prime seat on the patio where I watched Vegas roll by - the best part about early morning Vegas is that there are only two sorts of people - the early morning joggers and the people just heading home.  I laughed like hell when a guy came up and yelled ""high five - yellow shirt - I love yellow shirts"" with regard to my vintage LA Kings T.  Only in Vegas.

Having heard much about Mon Ami Gabi's view - truly awesome sitting 4 feet above Las Vegas Boulevard and directly across from the fountains at Bellagio - I must admit I'd heard mixed reviews of the food and went in with tempered expectations.  Greeted by my server and handed a menu I was offered coffee which I graciously accepted.  A decent French Roast with heavy nuttiness the coffee was good, but probably the worst I had during my trip to Vegas...and refills were slow at best despite the restaurant being unfilled throughout my meal.  Browsing the menu I was impressed by both the sweets and the savories - deciding between the Blueberry French Toast and Poached Pear Waffles proved difficult and thus I ended up with neither.   Placing my order I also opted to order a pain au chocolate from the limited bakery menu.

Sitting for nearly 30 minutes while I waited for my food I sipped my coffee and watched the street - I've said it before and I'll say it again, half the ""Vegas Experience"" is people watching.  Eventually arriving along with only my first refill of coffee (I had to request it - thankfully after this service improved and a young man took over my coffee refills) I was somewhat surprised when the sweet arrived with my savory breakfast.  Cool and questionably fresh the Pain au Chocolate was appropriately buttery and flakey but lacked any pizzazz.  Featuring a small single vein of average chocolate I could've gotten the same dish for much less than $3.50 at most convenience stores.

Where I would consider the sweet a failure - I didn't even finish it - my savory at MAG was actually a unique take on a classic and quite delicious.  Described as a ""classic"" Croque Madame the dish was actually presented in a ""deconstructed"" fork and knife sandwich manner with two large slices of hearty grain bread pan fried in butter and then cut in half, topped with ham and gruyere cheese plus chives, and finished with a sunny-side up egg.  Accompanying the croque on the plate was a simple salad of frisee and vinegar and on a side plate were some oily and uninspiring (and decidedly American) hash browns with Heinz ketchup poured into a small cup.  While good this croque and accoutrements certainly wasn't as good as the version the previous day at Pinot and no-where near on par with the versions in Northern California at Butler and the Chef or Bouchon.

Finishing my meal and sipping on my coffee again my female server finally returned to my table to ask if I needed anything else - when I asked for a ""to go"" cup of coffee plus the check this duty was pawned off on the young man who'd been filling my coffee while she went back to talking to the other female server near the register.  Like Pinot I simply don't understand why ""bistro"" entails sub-par service in Las Vegas and I actually mentioned on my way out suggesting that I wanted my tip (left in cash as opposed to on my credit card as I normally do on vacation) be given to the young man and not my ""server.""  In general I can't say there is much to brag about at Mon Ami Gabi aside from the view and while the restaurant would certainly stand at the top of French cuisine in Columbus Ohio (my home) I'd much sooner go back to Pinot, Bouchon, Payard, or Tableau when in a dining destination city like Las Vegas.",10/12/2009 1:01,36.1574851,-115.2441902,1151 S.

I am so glad to discover this away from the strip gem. Now I have a place where I can grab fancy little treats without having to travel all the way to strip and truck my way through a busy crowded casino to indulge in beautiful desserts.

The reviews all have pretty much the same thing to say about how the cakes have no flavors and even though I have to agree I didn't have any this visit to judge but I did have some during Christmas when a customer of mine brought in a roll and the cake part itself was a little bland. But then again I know how Asian bakery or cakes are a little more on the dense and not too sweet side. With that said that's the only reason why I docked them 1 star, otherwise I would have given them a full 5 stars. 

I am a little bit of a sweet tooth so I do wish that their cakes were sweeter. But everything I got today was so good. I will be back for more because I enjoy me some fancy sweet treats that are beautifully displayed in such a close comfy shop!

Our server, Victoria, was certainly the highlight of the evening. Wife and I totally appreciated her suggestions, her great attitude, and attentiveness.

We had a few appetizers, deviled eggs (with crispy prosciutto)..a little underseasoned but very tasty. (hey chef...salt and pepper are your friends in the kitchen)

Meatballs Al Forno...these were perfect (some of the best ever) with a little heat to the sauce and grilled levain...which is an ostentatious way of saying tiny pieces of grilled sourdough bread. Chef...more sauce and a couple more pieces of bread...uhhh...levain.

For DInner, wife had the Pan Seared Salmon which she loved and I had the Skirt Steak Tacos with a side of Bacon Cheddar Tots. Tacos were a little on the dry side but tasty and the tots were amazing with the sriracha ketchup.

The decorations and the architect is amazing.  All the fountains are grand and gorgeous.  The Fountain of the Gods is technically a show and it plays every hour on the hour.  Kinda freaky though with the statue moving....

I live in another state for work but I still wanted to have my wedding in my home town.  Planning a wedding long distance is extremely stressful.  I pretty much did all of my planning on line and on the phone.  I had my mother and best friend check out Sunset Gardens for me.  They loved the place so I picked it for my wedding venue.

  About two months prior to my wedding date (May 4, 2013), I got calls from the cake maker and flower vendor.  They were very helpful with examples over email and there were a few websites I was able to look at to make my final decisions.  I got a phone call from one of the planners about a month out for the rest of the details.  I was a little nervous because it all seemed so easy.  The staff at Sunset Gardens really put me at ease and assured me that they would take care of everything.  Through the whole process I was in contact with Tony, the owner/wedding planner.  The man is a god send.  He answered all my questions and I had quite a few.  He even thought of things I didn't think of and I consider myself a very detail oriented person.  

  The week of my wedding I went to Sunset Gardens to finally check out the venue.  I was fully impressed.  The place is beautiful and it can hold up to three weddings.  There is privacy for each ""room"" so the brides don't  see each other.  The pictures on the website really don't do it justice.  You have to see it to believe it.  A few days prior I got a phone call from the wedding DJ (DJ Syd) and the pastor. They were extremely friendly.  Everything you need for your wedding is in the same shopping center as Sunset Gardens.  It's very convenient!  I went to the dress store to get my bridesmaids dresses steamed before the ceremony and the dresses were in the dressing room hours before the ceremony.

   The day of my wedding I met my coordinator for the day, Chris.  Chris was nice, funny and had every detail worked out before I got there.  He, like the rest of the staff, totally put me at ease.  I felt like I didn't have to do anything.  I ended up staying at the venue in my dressing room a few hours before the ceremony to wait for my makeup artist.  I actually felt like I was at home because of how warm the staff was and how adamant they were in ensuring I was comfortable.  It really was a great experience.

  The ceremony and reception turned out to be perfect.  The catering staff helped me set up the centerpieces.  That was a huge help.  My guests told me that the food served was the best wedding food they ever had and some got seconds.  Our cake was amazing.  The ambiance was beautiful.  The open bar was a great highlight.  My only issue was that the DJ announced the wrong name for our flower girl.  We didn't end up getting DJ Syd, I believe we got Rufus.  The photographer had a lot of great picture ideas. I can't wait to see them.  

  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone planning a wedding in Vegas.  I wish we had more time at the reception.  3 hours was definitely not enough.  Our guests had so much fun that I had to have my family members push them out.  People did not want to leave.    This was totally worth every penny.

It was anything but. First mistake? We got a brunch menu at 12pm on a Friday. Was expecting lunch so I had to readjust my decisions. They brought a bread basket to the table but it was all muffins and weirdly butter-heavy brunch items that I did not care for. Ordered a burger medium rare. It was medium, a sloppy mess to eat, and had no flavor. The avocado it came with had too much pepper on it and, while the fries were crispy how I like them, they were overly salty. On our way out we walked past the guy grilling burgers. He had 15 hockey pucks in a tray below the grill. And by hockey pucks I mean overcooked burgers that are NOT MADE TO ORDER.

A three-course burger meal at Bradley Ogden's in Caesar's Palace is $30, a price I would never pay for a burger, but since there are tons of raves for the burgers and I like the fancy restaurant aesthetic and service I decided that it would be a great place to use a voucher.

I sat at the bar and had a great Bourbon Sour. I order this drink virtually everywhere and the sour mix is the only thing that makes the difference from restaurant to restaurant. I'm guessing they make their own here as the drink was excellent.

I ordered the Burger Prix Fixe with the caesar salad. The caesar was excellent. I really like how they do the whole romaine heart and I need to figure out how to get it adequately coated with caeser dressing at home without ripping it to shreds. Also, the sheets of parmesan were awesome.

Now, the caesar salad came out very quickly, so I was a bit concerned that my burger would be following shortly. But no, things worked just how I liked it. I didn't get the burger until  a few minutes after the salad plate had been cleared. I really, really hate restaurants that bring your courses out practically on top of each other so I really appreciated the perfect time gap here.

The fries were awesome, with big pieces of salt crystal on them (sea salt or kosher, I guess). I LOVE the taste of salt hitting my tongue and the slightly garlicly mayonnaise was nice and creamy with the fries. Could have had a little more garlic in it though.

Onto the burger -- initially, I thought it just tasted like a normal tasty burger, good but nothing that special, nothing to get worked up about. But somehow the taste improved as it cooled down and I guess maybe because the burger bun was marinating in the burger juices or something because by the time I got to the last bite I was going MMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm. So yes, it was a very good burger. Was it the best burger I ever had? I don't think so, but it was damn good and the surroundings and the service and the presentation were all awesome so that all adds up to a pretty great experience. 

Now dessert - The butterscotch pudding was literally a tablespoon or so of pudding. WTF?

Save yourself time and major stress!
Unless you have alot of money and don't care that they charge double, even triple then others for the same procedures. 
I took my poodle in for a spay and teeth cleaning that my husband had scheduled. He was given a quote of 185.00 for the cleaning and 85.00 for the spay. Now mind you I had taken my other dog in over 5 years ago here and got robbed then with the cleaning and ex-ray thing that was a 550.00. They charged me way to much then for an extraction but my dog was under and had to make a decision. 
But this is the place he searched out... so I was taking our pup at 8am and he is picking up. Thinking he spoke to someone got the quote and were all good. NO that's not how it went at all. Once we got there we needed to add bloodwork another 90.00, the cone that was another 11.75. (because they can't leave the place without that) 
Then there were a few more 10.00 charges here and there for medicine and miscellaneous.
Then there was a charge of 35.00 for a dog over 5 years old. Ridiculous!!! 
That's where I said I'm done!!!
 I will go to Leid animal shelter for 90.00 out the door. 
The reason we didn't go to Leid was we wanted both done at the same time and they don't clean teeth anymore.
Now let's get back to the cleaning. The ex rays are 75.00 this is an option until they have an extraction ( which I was told by the Dr. Was most likely happening by the looks of the teeth. Now how many?  who knows... To the tune of 50.00 to 100.00 per tooth. Then they require the ex-rays of 75.00. Antibiotics and pain medicine I can't remember that cost on those... and on and on. They show you two columns one is Low end I was looking at 600.00 plus and the other column is the higher end and it was over 1100.00
I took our little rescue dog and left after an hour and 10 minutes. That's how long it took for me to review all the hidden costs and call my husband to tell him about all the crazy up charges. 
I was so upset and now late for work... Never again!
I called Durango Animal hospital and will be going there. It came recommended by two others. Their extractions range from 15.00 to 120.00 depending on the tooth of course and the loose ones are free....teeth cleaning 135.00.
This sounds better all ready.
8/14 update we took our dogs to Durango Animal Hospital. It was great !! 185.00 for teeth cleaning and that is with two extractions. No blood work and no mandatory X-ray with the extractions. It was a true bargain and no up sales.

Housekeeping came by at 9pm to ask if I wanted my room cleaned. No? Wtf is wrong with them? They're supposed to be cleaning when i'm NOT THERE. 

Also, I had to wait until 6pm to check in because they weren't done cleaning my room. The front desk said they'd call me when it was ready but they never did (I waited 2 hours). When I went back to the desk to ask, they claimed they did (LIARS). 

I called some toll free numbers from the room phone and lo and behold, because I dialed *9* to get out of the 702 area code, I had to pay $1 per call. On top of the daily $1 telephone access fee.

Long Answer/Review:

I do love me a good burger and this is supposedly one of the better burgers from a chain so I wanted to try it out after seeing this at the mall that I was at.

I am not sure what I was expecting when I went inside as I literally have had no experience with Shake Shack at all. It was a very clean facility and nicely decorated. There were even table games for kids, or some adult children like me. So that was a nice addition. The staff here was also very friendly and helpful.

Now for the meat...;) of the review.

I got myself a double shack burger and the buns of the burger was the best part of the burger. It was very soft and cooked nicely. What I didn't like about it was that it was a very small bun. Also the bun was only cut like 3/4 of the way through which creates a sort of bun envelope which is the first time eating a burger that way. Spoiler alert...I didn't like it. The way the contents of the burger were pushed into the buns made it seem like a big burger...until I took the burger out of the tissue paper. Making a burger this way makes it so you don't get an even bite of the contents which is unfortunate because this could have been a more delicious burger if the ingredients were able to mix together in every bite.

The fries were actually pretty decent. I have had bad experiences with crinkle cut fries in the past. These fries were not dry and nicely salted. There's not much else to say other than these were pretty good fries.

Overall this place is decent at best. Will I be coming back here? Yes, but only when I am shopping at the mall. This place is a little on the pricier side when it comes to burgers so it's not a place that I would be driving out of the way for or anything. Definitely better burger joints out there but not a bad place to be if you're looking for a quick bite to eat.

Until Next Time, Happy Eating!",1/22/2018 6:09,36.0838937,-115.1537166,5757 Wayne Newton Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89019,"Restaurants, Fast Food, Mexican, Tex-Mex",Restaurants,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Baja Fresh

I understand why there is so much love for XS. This is the kind of venue you would see in a movie that is showing what Vegas nightlife is like. They have all the right pieces to make a fun experience but it has never been on the top of the list of places for me. I think because I am not into the EDM world and because when I dance I want a place that is comfortable and it is hard to make that happen with the XS setup. 

When you enter XS which has a great Wednesday night option as well as fun weekends there is a very picturesque outside setup. Honestly it's one of the coolest outside seating options I have ever seen. There are several mini pools and then larger ones that VIPs can sit beside and lounge if they want to get away from the main dancefloor. Most of the club is located outside so you are completely at the mercy of the Vegas weather on how much fun you will have in this place. When it is cold they have heat lamps like many other clubs but you can't get over the fact that you are freezing. It's something that Chateau and Pure face as well so you know what you are getting into when you venture into a place like this. Seriously I couldn't get over how great this outside set up was. I am not into outside seating or hanging out and just talking to people. I come to Vegas to dance and no matter how fancy of a setup it is if it's not fun to get down on the dancefloor I lose interest.

Once you are past the seating you get to the main dancefloor which as a bar close to the entrance and on the sides. There is a dancefloor in the middle that spills out into the outside seating area mentioned and people are crammed in trying to stay in the warmth or cold of the inside dancing area depending on the weather. We went in the middle of summer and honestly it was just too fucking hot to enjoy this place. Maybe it changes with more temperate weather but it was just a sweaty and exhausting mess before we even made it to 11pm. 

The DJ inside was okay he played a mix of EDM and scattered rounds of hip hop which we tried to soak in while they lasted. Eventually later in the night Will.I.Am came out with RedFoo and performed a few sets on the DJ setup in the outside seating area. This was a really really weird thing. The area outside if very small to watch so the crowd was watching from inside and outside but there wasn't really a place to dance so it broke out into weird personal dance battles. They were also competing with the DJ still playing inside but the music bled into each other so you couldn't really enjoy either performance. 

Overall the music was average and the setup while great looking wasn't really fun or conducive to dancing. XS is great to look at but once you get to the clubbing part you realize you aren't really having that much fun. I would give the Wednesday night a shot or even if I was going with a date or a group of friends that just wanted to hang out I would make this trip again but overall I feel there are better nights out than XS to be had in Vegas.

We were going for a later meal, wanted something casual that wasn't a buffet and one of the casino employees mentioned this place had good pizza so the other non-New Yorkers were lured in (as someone who has had fantastic pizza here in NYC and Chicago I was skeptical).

We were promptly seated (for a party of 8 we had our own private dining area), and our waitress was very prompt and attentive to our table.  They have a small menu, but it catered to our different dietary restrictions (some were doing a Paeleo diet, some were doing low carb, some were vegetarian... it's hard to please 8 women sometimes!).

I ended up getting the sausage and peppers sandwich, the well suited, and a few of us tried the margharetia pizza .   The drink was nice and strong, and was the best part of my meal.  The sausage and peppers sandwich was flavorful, though the amount of bread was overwhelming to the amount of sausage and pepers within the sandwich so it was mostly bread.  The pizza, though we requested it be cut in 8 (usually their pies are cut in 6), was cut oddly so it wasn't an equitable division of pizza amongst our party (so we ended up cutting some slices in half), however the taste was bland and the crust though well done on the edges, could have been cooked a bit more and tasted a bit raw.

I went here due to a referral, upon meeting one of the shop owners, I was assured they would get my repairs handled once insurance adjuster came out to finalize details. The owners never communicated with me, I was only informed of what was going on once I reached out to insurance. Apparently the owner was telling them false information about the acc6that occurred without even speaking to me and creating all kinds of issues between insurance and myself because they were making up random facts. Thats just the start. They had my car in their shop for 2 whole months! The guy kept telling me my car would be ready at a certain date and would then change it because something else popped up, he did this multiple times. He also lied to me and told me to come pick up my car and then wouldn't answer his phone while I waited outside his new shop, pregnant and miserable. My husband had to contact his brother and got some bullshit story. Once I finally got a hold of the owner, he tells me that insurance didn't let him fix something and needs more money and I need to contact my insurance. Everything he said was complete bullshit. He then tells me he took my car to get washed and was in the area of my house. He brings my car over when it's dark outside and the car is not washed, it looks like shit, all the lights are on and he is making up all these excuses. I asked him why he was driving my car around? He says, oh I washed it. No you didn't, plus why would you wash a car that is not even fixed yet? And be driving it so far from the shop and he tells me, I'm going to park it at my house tonight. Why are you taking my car home?! Still, I let him take it back because it was not done and my insurance said they would handle it. After that he kept delaying when my car would be ready. When I went go pick it up, I was sick in the car and the guy barely pulled up. He did not even have my emblems on. My fiance quickly dealt with him and I took my car home. On closer look I noticed mismatched paint, glue everywhere, my letters were put on crooked. My trunk is not even connected right. It looks like an amateur garage tech did work on my car. 2 months of no vehicle and dealing with this guy and when I finally get my car, it looks horrible.

aYKSM9lz9ZMst5l7g1lpgQ,hqr0F0tU7CFCISxfEpuk1Q,cxFUcrfq1Fvh83tJyKhW8g,3,6,1,2,"I've decided to post an update to my original review after experiencing some less than stellar points about living here. I've deducted a star and here is why:

1. The rent has consistently been raised about $50/per month every year I`ve lived here(going on 4 years), and all of a sudden the rent is now being raised over $100/per month, which is super unfortunate because I considered this a pretty affordable complex for what it is. When I asked about the raise in rent, I was told that they had an option of raising is a certain percentage rate or raising it to market. I signed another year lease but I`m not sure how much longer beyond this next year I`ll be living here if they decide to raise the rent such a high amount again. It is a decent complex where I feel safe, but I feel a bit shafted.

2. I`m in a unit that is basically a loft above garages (my own and my neighbors). The most recent neighbors are noisy AF and they open and close their garage so many times. Now, I know that seems petty, but it is not petty when they are opening and closing their garage at 1, 2, 3, 4 in the morning. They also sound like they are having straight up dance parties in their garage at all hours and are generally disrespectful of the complex ""quiet time"". I did let the office know and I`ve noticed a slight change, but we'll see. So, note: if you are in loft style unit and you have neighbors who are loud, you are going to have a bad time.The units are in no way sound proof and I can hear people walking around in the units that surround mine. Not really the complex's fault, but I figured I would mention this.

3.  They recently all of a sudden informed all residents of inspections(with very short notice), which was inconvenient because everyone was basically told that our unit would be entered. Luckily I work from home so I was able to be home for this, but I was not pleased with how this all went down. Shortly after the first inspection(which was actually super quick and  the inspectors were very nice), they informed us of a second inspection(m'kay, what now?) This second inspection is what really tipped my over the edge of annoyance because the second group of inspectors, while nice, did not seem to respect my space. Let me back up and say that two of them seemed respectful and the third didn`t seem to give a crap about my living space. First of all, I feel personally like they should have had those removable booties because they just came on in with shoes and that is seriously not cool. This inspection lasted longer and I believe they were inspecting for any damages(which is what I thought the first inspection was for, but it was to check to see if the unit was ""upgraded""). Anyway,one of the inspectors, that went into my bedroom and bathroom area had knocked over a cup of water that I leave out for my kitty and instead of telling me ""Hey, I`m sorry, I knocked over a cup of water and now there is a mini flood in your bathroom"", he didn`t say anything and I had to walk into a bathroom with water all over the floor and  the cup just set to the side. Are you f'ing kidding me? So, definitely not pleased with the lack of professionalism of the chosen inspectors. Not a good experience and it makes me question the quality I`m paying for.

/End rant.

Like I mentioned before, the complex is fine overall and the office staff is generally nice and helpful, but these recent experiences have left a bad impression on me and I felt I needed to share them.",12/6/2018 15:15,36.1670561,-115.1454397,330 S 3rd St,NV,Las Vegas,89101,"Restaurants, American (New), Breakfast & Brunch, Nightlife, Bars",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Courthouse Bar & Grill

We were on a whirlwind tour of downtown which had our group of 10 on a hop of bars, restaurants, casinos and museums on Saturday afternoon/night. We started at Atomic Liquors for drinks, proceeded to Bin 702 in the Container Park, then the El Cortez, and culminating with a nighttime tour of the Las Vegas Neon Museum boneyard. So, Bin 702. A local--a waiter in one of our breakfast joints--recommended we try something in the Downtown Container Park. Everybody in our group was willing to try something different, and Bin 702 was not a conventional restaurant. I contacted them to see if they could accommodate our large-ish party, and Taryn quickly returned my email request to say they could accommodate us. Bin 702 is located in two connected shipping containers. The menu consists of small plates options, charcuteries and cheese boards, and montaditos (mini sandwiches). We had a fantastic variety of each as well as an excellent selection of craft beers and inventive cocktails. We started with two charcuterie boards which offered 4 meats, and two cheese boards, offering 4 cheeses. The menu described these boards as such: ""Artisan cheese and curated meat beautifully presented. All served with fig jam, honeycomb, whole grain mustard, olives, almonds and dried cherries."" Forgive me for not remembering the specific meats and cheeses on these boards, suffice it to say EVERYTHING was delectable, especially when paired with the fig jam and mustard! Next we split three montaditos samplers which included the following: Flamin' Hot Cheeto - house spread, white cheddar; Bresaola - St. André, Brie - Apple, almond, honey; Turkey - Fig jam, smoked gouda; Sopressata - whole grain mustard; and Lobster. The Turkey and Brie were so good we ordered another serving of 6 sandwiches of just those two options. Everything was prepared with care and wonderfully presented. Speaking of my drink option, I had the local craft brew, Big Dog Las Vegas Lager, which paired really well with all of the food I ate. As if the food and drink were not enough, our server, Naomi was FANTASTIC, happily engaging with our group throughout the evening. I'd recommend Bin 702 based on the food alone, but I heartily recommend Bin 702 for its atmosphere as well. In all, a wonderful experience.

I had their ""Blue Plate Special"" (two pieces of Lewellyn's fine fried chicken, honey hot sauce
chilled spiced watermelon, house-made buttermilk biscuit) which was amazing. The chicken is brined for over 24 hours and is super moist. The batter was spot on.

I also tried half a ""Swine Burger"" (short rib, brisket, and chuck blend, house smoked pork belly, house pickles smoked gouda cheese, pickled onions, frisée). This was a delicious. There were so many flavors going on with each bite! Try it drizzled with their bourbon sauce

I specifically asked that table on terrace next to private dining area, they even called me to confirm, but a large party from the convention at the cosmopolitan threw a private diner party there the last minute, they rented the entire area! :( just my luck.... The restaurant called to let me know that they would try to get us a window table with nice views, ok.... What else they could do? Got there a bit late, host girl told us we could wait 2 minutes for a window table, sure....we waited at the bar for exactly 2 minutes or less, didn't even get the cocktails we ordered yet, host girl took us to a corner table next to the windows, I could see PH and strip! It was beautiful! After about 15 minutes, all the dining people around us finished dinner, it was quiet and romantic again! How sweet! Loved it! 

Our cocktails were as tasty as usual, ordered fresh oysters and pickled jar to start, seriously they have the freshest and sweetest oysters I have ever had! We order oysters everywhere, this place is no doubt #1 on my list! The pickled jar was so good, sour and salty, I didn't finish it intentionally, had it boxed for my late night snack after excessive drinking, I knew I would need it.; p

The specials written on a board were salad, steak and beef choices, I didn't want and couldn't have anything, so I just ordered a couple small plates, no entrees either, I guess my appetite wasn't that good the entire trip, don't know why... That's never happened to me...

Chilled half lobster:: OhMy. Loved it, so tender, I didn't want the cream sauce came with it, asked for horseradish, it was amazing, the lobster meat was so fresh! 

Sautéed spinach: they didn't have that on the menu, they managed to find some spinach in the kitchen, and made that side just for me, how sweet! Loved it, light, fresh with enough flavors. 

Creamless corn: unique flavor, very light but still tasty! 

Special of the day beef: it looked like marinated beef stew in French version to me, it was tender, just hubby didn't like the flavor, he said it tasted a bit weird. I guess he still prefers steak no mater what?! 

Salmon tartare: liked how tiny they were, looked so cute, it was good but not great, still delicious though. 

Had a Grey Goose martini as usual, and a French champagne to finish the meal, it was PERRIER-JOUËT I believe, $27, it was perfect! What a meal, the views were definitely beautiful, that dining table was a very nice spot for a romantic and quiet dinner date, now I know two perfect spots to dine in that restaurant!

They try to run this like a fine dining restaurant but it appears they no longer have the quality of food to do it.  And the staff tries really hard but seems overwhelmed, even when it isn't busy.

One thing that really bugged me - we got the dim sum sampler ($16).  About 10 dumplings in a stacked metal steamer, and they did not put the paper in the bottom.  AND they served soup dumplings!  For those not familar, soup dumplings are just what they sound like - they have soup in them.  When you don't put wax paper or some other non-stick material at the bottom of a metal steamer, the dumplings stick. So you have to yank the dumpling off the bottom of the steamer and soup goes everywhere.  Now its just a dumpling skin.  Ugh.

The lobster tacos ($21) we got were interesting.  Three tacos in a crunchy shell filled with something that looks like chicken salad, but it's lobster.  It comes with a tiny guacamole shake with a straw.  My husband and I had no problem sharing the tiny shake but I can see that being an issue for less intimate dining companions.  I liked the presentation, but tacos weren't very flavorful.

Everything was just ok - from sushi to cocktails.  We did not stay for dessert.  The menu is way to varied for this restaurant to do anything good.

Yes, it is hot. Yes, it is humid. Your body will thank you later and challenge you to do new things you never thought you could do! Hot yoga IS for everyone. Your body will scream at you to leave, but push yourself and fly to new heights in your mental focus.

I have been taking the traditional 90 minute Bikram class for a few years now, and I came here to try the 26 & 2 75 minute class. The variance in the sequence was really nice, and the first breathing exercise was just one set. 

The class was nice and juicy, but the doors were opened, new air pumped in, and the fans turned on at the right times. We stayed on the mat for the entire class. This was so helpful for me. I have a lifelong injury and it's very difficult for me to stand on carpet or hard floor where there is little grip. I've had a couple instructors at other studios call me out on this. It was nice to have the extra resistance. 

Patrizia is a great instructor. She played relaxing music before and after class, and passed out cold towels soaked with lovely essential oils. I look forward to have classes with the rest of the instructor that rotate here. 

Jami and Geoff's power series classes are great as well. For those of you that crave structure in your routine (like me!) these classes will allow you to concentrate on the technique and less on the unexpected. Jami pushed me to take one, and I'm so glad I did. She was dead on that I would love it. 

The locker rooms are amazingly clean. They have digital lockers, so you don't have to worry about bringing a lock or taking a risk at leaving your wallet in an open cubby. The showers were bright white, not a spec of dirt. Shampoo, conditioner, and body wash provided. Plenty of floor space to get changed. I have felt very crowded at other studios in town.

The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either. We split the spinach and artichoke dip, which I liked because they actually had chunks of artichoke in it, but the chips served with it were SUPER SALTY, beware!

I ordered the fish and chips, which weren't bad, but lots of batter! I also got the white peach sangria which was delish but super weak, tasted like juice and I got no buzz/asian glow from it whatsoever.

The best thing about Rainforest Cafe is the amazing decor. Tanks filled with exotic fish around the restaurant. The huge mushroom bar in the middle, with the funny stools that make you look like you have an animal butt. Then inside its like you're in an actual rainforest, trees and branches everywhere!

After I called and could not reach a human initially, I reached out to them on FB and received a response within 20 min.  They quickly let me know that they sold out for tomorrow (which is understandable since it's the last day of the month).

Vince is the man. From being accommodating and friendly on the phone (taking my dog last minute on a busy day) to greeting wookie and taking the time to know him (special treatments or handling) where Wookie felt comfortable enough that he wasn't shaking and crying with Vince holding him speaks volumes to me. He's like the Cesar Milan of the grooming world. 
When I went to pick wookie up, Wookie looked like a million bucks and actually was up and perky (usually he's in a cage with his head down). He told me of any issues he noticed with Wookie.. I'm talking about small details you would notice if you lived with Wookie for years. Vince was able to pick up on things and reacted accordingly and with compassion... He also brought a couple of things to my attention. He did things the harder way rather than just buzzing off his hair and did what was right for the dog not what was easy and fast which is hard to come by these days.

Came around lunch time with a few friends. Maybe we should have just held out and done the wait at GyuKaku, but we were hungry so we made our way over here from the promising Yelp reviews. Welp.

The restaurant was basically empty save for one other table of 2 that was already set up and eating when we (party of 4) arrive. Despite this, service was quite intermittent and the servers looked annoyed and were not too helpful with our contemplation over the combos. 

Ordered the pork and beef belly à la carte which comes as a combo with our selection of kimchi stew. 

The side dishes that came along were pretty good. Not many places that I have gone to have watermelon radish and I do appreciate that.

This place is one of those fancier places where the servers monitor and do the cooking for you over your table's grill. However, I almost wish they did not. No complaints about the beef, but the pork belly was just mutilated. 

The slab of pork was fairly thick and already came scored with fairly deep cuts up and down - but was still promising. Yet this already prepped meat in combination with the server's small portioning/cutting and overcooking - destroyed it. One of my friends had tried to reach for a juicer piece off to the side of the grill but was scolded by the server in how the pork was ""not done yet"". By the time I had a chance to survey this meat- it was just too done.. dry- not fatty or juicy.. just sad.

And the kimchi stew was crazy salty.",1/5/2019 10:09,36.1356534,-115.1615056,2901 S Las Vegas Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Restaurants, American (New)",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Big Burger

From the classy interior (including a second floor old-timey casino lounge) to the outrageously attentive service to the delicious Italian food (appetizers through espresso)...LAVO would absolutely be your all-time favorite Italian place if it (and you) were back in the suburbs of Ohio or Tennessee or wherehaveyou.

As it is, LAVO has to compete with dozens of other top-shelf options within walking distance and that's where you went wrong. VEGAS HAS SPOILED YOU.

Though LAVO is roomey enough to easily accommodate large groups, I had a very small group sit down in a nice corner and enjoyed a brilliant 3-course meal where nothing we ate was less than excellent. The espresso and tiramisu deserve special recognition as there is no letting the foot off the pedal where many places leave dessert as an afterthought. Again, this was truly delicious from start to end. 

I've walked by this place many a time without even considering going in. If there's any downside it's that its location is so obvious it's kind of hidden in plain sight, but absolutely do not overlook this additional Italian GEM on the strip.

The ""Munch Box"" which sounds like a restaurant in the Tarantino movie universe took over the space that used to be owned by probably the worst deli/cafe that I've ever patronized. Not much has changed in the style department here, but the menu is a complete overhaul. It's all the bagel sandwich staples, lox, and capers, a variety of egg sandwiches, along with salads, deli sammies, and a full omelet menu. I've been here twice now and both times the food has been fantastic and made quick. The one downside is there no iced coffee offered, only hot coffee. Bummer! 

I tried the Tijuana breakfast sandwich, the three cheese egg sandwich, and the Poutine. The Tijuana is the one to get and comes stacked with three egg whites, jalapeno cream cheese, and whatever protein or bagel you want. I went with sausage and a jalapeno cheese bagel, which was super messy, but totally worth the seven napkins that were used to clean my face. This wasn't too spicy and was very filling. 

The surprise here is how good the Poutine tasted. No frills or crazy add-ons, just basic French fries, cheese curds, and brown gravy on top. This is a huge portion of food and could easily be shared with an another box muncher. 

This box is totally worth a munch. Come by and sink your teeth in.

They don't accept credit. Cash only or you pay 35 cents to use your debit. 8  years in Vegas first time I've seen that at a gas station.

He said hi, didn't put his phone down for another good 10 seconds. ""Are you working today?"" Scanned my item and back on his phone.

He really loves this place, there have been times that I actually have wondered if he'd rather stay there than come home with me. 
Even though my dog isn't a regular daycare dog, a few of the staff members still greet him by name and since you can just drop in (if your dog has been pre-approved for daycare) it's not like they know we are coming. That alone makes me feel pretty comfortable knowing my dog will be well taken care of. 
There has only been one time that my dog was in a little scuffle with another dog (because dogs will be dogs) I swear the staff were so much more concerned over the small cut on his ear, and assuring me that they cleaned it and that it wasn't my dogs fault etc, that I felt like a very neglectful parent over the general lack of concern i had regarding the very mild scrape to my dogs ear.

Food:

Clam Chowder- Creamy and delicious. They were very generous on the clam bits and potato. Highly recommend sharing between 2 people. 

Oysters- They had different tiers of oysters going at different price. We got a dozen Blue Point oysters for $28 and a dozen of another kind that I forgot....(same tier as Kumamoto) for $35. The oysters were extremely fresh and fatty AND SWEET. I was in oyster heaven. 

O.B. Pan Roast- They put a good variety of seafood in it, my favorite was the clams. The crab legs they had was a bit overcooked and so was the lobster. The broth was a bit watery to my liking, but overall the flavor was not bad.

The second time however was a complete 180! 
I don't know if their flavor selections are extensive, I only ever order taro milk tea w/ boba, so that's all I look for. 

The wait was a little long and there was no one in front of us and we only ordered 3 teas. I would wait longer for the tea I received! 

The taro tea flavor was spot on and the boba was perfection. Soft and chewy with a little sweetness, as if they soak them in honey after cooking, not sure if this is the process but that's how I make mine at home and it tastes the same.  

Now I'm on a slippery slope. This is the closest boba place near me and I have missed out on so many since I quit going for a while after my first visit. I have a lot of missed visits to catch up on.

For starters we shared the Maust Khiar, which is always my favorite app (yogurt cucumber dish) and the Kashk e Bademjan, which is the eggplant app that was the table favorite, it was very different and savory. We all tried something different, I went with the Chelo kebab koobideh which is the ground beef kebab, one friend had the shish kebab and the other the chicken kebab. I wasn't a huge fan of the ground beef kebab, it reminds me of sausage and I don't love sausage, I liked the shish kebab the best. The basmati rice is ok, I've had better, but if you spend an extra $2.95 you can choose a different rice, and my friend got the Adas polo which is basmati rice with raisins, lentils, dates and saffron and it was delicious. Almost like dessert. Prices were reasonable, and the dishes were large, I had enough for dinner and lunch the next day. The iced tea was so good, I drank half a pitcher.

Me and my mom ordered the 3 meat treat. We got beef tips, hot links, 1/4 slab spare ribs with sweet potato fries and collard greens as the sides. 

The hot links could have been a bit more tender, but were delicious on the other hand. Beef tips tasted good, even though they were essentially small steak pieces. LOVED the ribs, they were tender and practically fell off the bone. The collard greens were quite tasty and the sweet potato fries had a perfect ratio of sweetness and typical french fry flavor. 

The atmosphere is pretty interesting. It's slightly hole in the wall-ish but clean. I loved the pictures on the wall, it gave the place a VERY homey feel, the service is pretty homey as well. Another nice thing to note are the names of many of the dishes, which are supposedly named after members of TC's family.

I visited Pizza Rock for lunch at the recommendation of one of the tour guides at the Mob Museum. (There's a discount with admission). Its an incredibly spacious restaurant with lots of different pizza options. 
I ordered the highly recommended margherita pizza and the 3 meatball appetizer. This was (WAY) more than enough food for one person. I was really pleased with the meatballs. They were tender, meaty and swimming in a great red sauce. 
The pizza was not my favorite. It edge crust had a nice char, but the center was slightly underdone (and a bit cold). I will preface this by saying the the mozzarella, fresh basil and the bright tomato sauce were all perfect. Also, I know that this pizza is not meant to be crisp, but the center was distinctly uncooked. Being the slob that I am, i just cut off the corner of each slice and enjoyed the rest.

Just so wrong.  As Brad KNOWS, from his own experience, having a break-in is a horrible ordeal, that leaves one feeling totally violated in every way:  things that had been saved for over 30 years were stolen and can never be replaced, giving a whole new perspective on life.   If you read Kimberly's review, you'll see that Brad is not a nice person, and will look at you and lie to your face.  Not a good business man at all.  You'll notice that there are no more ""guarantee commercials"" because i wrote to the BBB and had them stopped.  If he were a descent man, he would have paid the deductible as his commercial stated and probably not had so many bad reviews.  I'm sure that the previous comments were directed to me, but I can assure you that there was no insurance scam with my home, just a faulty product.  A bedroom window screen, made and installed by security screen masters, was removed from my home and entry was made allowing thieves to steal my belongings again, so don't feel that if you buy their product you are guaranteed safety.  The screens LOOK beautiful, but that is all.  The door locks are cheaply made and you cannot purchase them anywhere else,  I have had two of the locks break:  luckily i purchased extra locks from them after i found out that you cannot purchase locks ANYWHERE ELSE, and before my home was burglarized that second time.  When this next lock breaks i will have to remove the SSM door and purchase a steel door from a decent reputable company like Lowes or Home Depot.  $1500 is better spent there than with this company.  I spent a total of $14000 with this company and deeply regret it.  Today, while cleaning an upstairs window, I opened a SSM screen FOR THE SECOND TIME EVER, cleaned the window and attempted to lock the screen.  The screen would not come into the ledge enough to lock, so as i pulled the handle, which i soon found out was PLASTIC, the handle broke off in my hand.  So i had to have a friend go to the roof and hold the screen in while i maneuvered the latch to lock.  TOTAL CRAP.  If I didn't love my house so much, I'd sell it and let the next person deal with this crappy hardware.  As i cleaned the other window, I recalled them removing all of my window screens and throwing them into their truck.  I commented that i had paid over $700 for all of those screens and now they were worthless.  He told me that I got ripped off.  That was the screens for 8 windows.  But they didn't feel that i was ripped off for the one ""sunscreen""  that was shabbily installed for $275 by SSM. So, If you don't believe in anything that I am writing, please read the other reviews regarding the kind of business person that Brad is, check with the BBB on complaints, and ask to see the door hardware and the window hardware before you spend $10-20,000 on their product.

So when some friends of ours invited us out to Viva Mercado's, which happened to be one of my bookmarks, I couldn't turn it down. Sadly, the quality fell way short of what I expected after reading so many great reviews.

The restaurant itself, which sits in the farther SW corner of the center, is actually quite nice. It's a bit smaller than I expected just judging from the view outside, but there's still a decent amount of seating. On top of the bar and dining area inside, they also have a really cool patio area outside. Alongside a few tables, they have a neat family style, bar height fire-pit type thing that looks to seat about 10+. Since our visit was on a chillier night, we decided to sit inside, but if I were to return and the weather was nice, I'd request those seats. And for what it's worth, our party of 6 arrived just after 6pm on a Friday and got seated within 15 minutes. 

Much like similar restaurants, Viva Mercado's has a pretty extensive menu. Several pages offer everything from appetizers to combo plates. They also have one of the biggest seafood selections I've seen from similar style restaurants, which I now wish I had ordered from. I ended up going with the Mulitas, which they serve basically like a big open face taco. They offer it with several types of meats, and I opted for the carnitas. Quality wise, I'd say they're just about a notch above Macayo's, which really isn't saying much. The meat was dry, the tortillas were stale and there was so much sour cream on top of it, that I could barely taste anything else. After picking through it, there was little flavor to anything else on the plate anyway. I'm also not a huge fan of the rice and beans they have, which just seems like those cheap heat and serve sides. The highlight of our meal was the complimentary chips, served with a side a fried jalapeños and onions. I ended up eating more of those than my meal.   

For the most part, our service wasn't terrible, but it could definitely use some work. I ordered an iced tea that was obviously old and had been brewed a while back, so I just ordered a water on top of it that I planned to drink, but I never got it. That was a slight mishap and easy to overlook, but the biggest problem was with one of our friends who had a huge headache with his meal. He ordered a combo meal, which normally comes with rice and beans, but he requested no beans and double rice. When his plate came out, they gave him the rice and beans like it's normally served. He immediately told them that it was incorrect, so they took the plate back, but then brought out double beans and no rice. After having to tell them 3 times and sending his plate back twice, they still couldn't get it right and just ended up bring him a side plate of rice. Something so simple just turned into a huge ordeal. 

Overall, if you're a fan of restaurants like Macayo's then you will probably like Viva Mercado's. But I am not, and Macayo's is actually one of my least favorite restaurants. So with food that is barely a step above that, and service that is lacking, I can't say I'll be coming back here anytime soon.",3/17/2015 2:35,36.2619696,-115.2477498,"7045 W Ann Rd, Ste 110",NV,Las Vegas,89130,"Restaurants, Chinese, Seafood",Restaurants,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Asian Kitchen Chinese Cuisine
COJYcSjLkxgHpUzDvYfc6Q,EhdKnqsqZf07Awj2oWxjZQ,eAc9Vd6loOgRQolMXQt6FA,4,1,1,1,"This is my favorite budget friendly hotel in Vegas!

I usually stay at MGM for work (plus it's cheap), and when I'm vacationing either Encore, Aria, or Pallazo (more expensive but better when I want to enjoy).

However, because of a 2 free night deal, we decided to give Mandalay Bay a shot, and we were pleasantly surprised.

The lobby/entrance is nice, fresh smelling, and open... which is a trait I love about Wynn/Encore/Aria.  The staff were very friendly, and helped us out with everything.  

Casino floor was adequate, dealers were friendly, there were plenty of tables open, and the vibe was nice and relaxed.  I was able to sit down and play for a good 3-4 hours with no problems, save for the occasional drunkard playing 1 hand and then leaving.

There are also a lot of nice restaurants and a nice shopping area... as well as an aquarium.  The aquarium was kind of fun, but I admit I would not go back unless my niece wanted to again (she is 2 years old).  She thoroughly enjoyed the aquatic life, however I thought it was a bit short and not very awe-inspiring.

The coolest thing about this hotel, however, is the pool!  Out of all the pools I've been to in Vegas, this one takes the cake!  The real-sanded beach leading to the wave-pool is the best place to come and relax and enjoy a drink or too.  There's also beach side food to keep you satisfied, and music is just loud enough so you can bob your head yet not get a head-ache.  They also have a beach-side gaming area where you can gamble, I wish I had more time to check that out.  What can get better than gambling by the beach??? Hot cards, hot girls, hot weather, and alcohol... sounds perfect to me!

The rooms were also very nice.  We got a 2 queen bed room, it was nice and spacious and the bathroom was updated as well.  There was also a nice sitting area with a desk for us to prop open our laptops and check e-mails/etc.  Only bad thing about the room is our carpet felt a little bit damp, hopefully it was people coming from the pool and not something else.... oh well.  Other than that, room seemed fresh and clean... it was a lot nicer than rooms at places like MGM, but a step down from Pallazzo, Aria, Encore... etc.

Overall, this is a great hotel.  For the price, you can't really beat the experience! For something cheaper, go to MGM or something like that, for something more sophisticated, you can give encore/pallazzo/cosmo a try.  I would definitely come back here again with my buddies to enjoy the sun!

All in all, would definitely come back here again to enjoy the pool area and what not.",9/4/2011 21:05,36.1214517,-115.1696112,3355 Las Vegas Blvd S,NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Restaurants, Chicken Wings, Food",Restaurants,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Chicken Now Venetian

Good thing I was home! 

When they arrived they asked to be walked around to see what needs most attention and where to clean. After explaining everything (and emphasizing downstairs was the priority) they went work. They worked on the second floor for 1.5 hours doing who knows what! Felt like it hadn't been cleaned much more than I would do before company arrives. The bed wasn't even fully made. They folded one blanket and just tossed the other two on separate sides. They spent their final 30 minutes downstairs in the previously discussed 'priority zone' cleaning the kitchen, living room and half bath leaving streaky counter tops, fridges and sticky floors with streaks all over.

I stop by here every now and then, usually for the produce. Sometimes they have deals that the larger chain stores just can't match. A lot of their stuff seems to come from Colorado so they must have a grower there or something.

They cover the gamut of grocery store items but just small enough as not to be overwhelming. Nice selection of bulk goods, candy, grains, etc. One of the better prices for Quinoa that I've seen.

I like their deli, always fresh. Their breads are decent if not a little expensive. They make their sausages on site and typically have sales going on for them

One of the main things here is in summer they do fire roast real New Mexico Hatch chiles in the parking lot and sell them rather cheaply. They freeze nicely so I always stock up! If you like peppers, you should check it out.

Meat was cooked a bit more than we would have liked - after a few trips we began asking for more rare cuts, which worked out great.

Pretty standard fare otherwise.  Went to the half price show kiosk to get a discount on the dinner - for $27 plus tax and tip (and free dessert for this review!) It was a great value on the strip.

Parking is generally a madhouse. I've gone when there are nothing but hand baskets available. I've heard a clerk tell a customer that he was sorry but it was so busy that they would just have to do without a cart. If a store has times where it is that busy, it would be prudent to invest in more carts.

While I like Smith's, be aware that brand coupons for items can not be used for items with a yellow ""manager's special"" coupon. For example, on the Smith's App there was special running which included a $1 off coupon for x brand organic, grass-fed beef, per package, no limit. I found 22 packages of that same brand in the manager's clearance section. I grabbed them all thinking I could use my unlimited coupon and save $22. When I got up to the register, my digital coupon was entered and a total of $0 was taken off. I asked why. Apparently, markdowns with the manager's special coupon are entered into the system as a generic item at X price rather than X brand at a cheaper price. Therefore, the computer system does not match the coupon to the marked down item because it can't match a specific brand to a generic listed product. Not cool.

If you bring in your own bag you get 5 gas points a bag. Also, there are tons of markdowns on preprepared deli foods, but they tend to be bland, gross or both. I've had the worst fried chicken of my life here.

I thought nothing could beat the traumatizing experience of seeing white male underwear (NOT boxers) which were stained blue for some reason abandoned in the middle of a Stratosphere hallway. . . I was wrong. Traumatizing is when you wake up in a smoking room, that REEKS of smoke when you booked a non-smoking room and find out that the comforter you were sleeping in had blood streaks all over the inside. Not blood streaks that you get after the sheets had been washed, but freshly dried blood streaks from sheets that had NOT been washed.

I treated my favorite unfiltered dame to a not so quick lunch this afternoon in between her onsite meetings. The overall experience of Ri Ra was exhausting despite the four star reviews. The ticket time was dreadful for starters while watching multiple servers pace back an forward with looks of confusion delivering food. Perhaps their table numbering system is off.    
I ended up inquiring with management about our food after waiting an unreasonable length of time (moments before it arrived). The restaurant wasn't busy on the front end at all.

My ""not so lucky"" white bean veggie burger $12 was absolutely disgusting! I literally left it on the table. This homemade patty texture was terrible and the flavor was even worse. 
My friend ordered the fish & chips $20. This whole filet of Icelandic haddock was massive! The taste was decent; no outstanding bold beer battered flavor to rave about. I did end up sharing the dish due to the generous portion (definitely shareable depending on your appetite). The fries (or chips) were soggy and blah just like the onion rings $6.

But first - do not be alarmed when you actually find the place.  In a very shabby strip mall well off The Strip - a few crappy stores and eateries, a few boarded up places, a smattering of panhandlers and transients (trying real hard to be politically correct).  Look past all this and go in the front door - and prepare to be pleasantly amazed.

Very large restaurant - crowded, hell of a wine cellar (in a Thai place - must be a Vegas thing).  Bit of a wait but not intolerable.  Polite and knowledgeable staff - and willing to take the time to explain the enormous menus and really help with your selection.

Started off with deep fried tofu and beef larb - off to a very good start.  A variety of main courses - and just a ridiculous amount of offerings to choose from.  Finally settled on the Rad Na, Nua Nam Tok and Koi Soi - all prepared well, plenty to eat and enough to share.  A good sampling for future visits.  Strong but not too strong Thai Ice Tea to wash it all down.

Walked into Bank's Oreck, and a representative from the Midwest was there to greet and assist me. He assessed my needs by asking a few questions, then directed me to a couple of nice choices. I purchased a Royal Lexon S15, and can hardly wait to use it.

There was a problem when I opened the box at home -- a wand and 3 or so key attachments were missing. I called, and Sevan handled the call courteously and displayed an interest in resolving the issue even though he stated that that model was sold out. He promised to work on getting the missing parts.

Early the next week, I decided to return the unit as I really needed to vacuum my new home. Emily was working, and went over backwards to compensate for the inconvenience. She was willing to comply with the return, but asked if I would keep it if she found the parts. Then, taking a head from a floor model of a different Royal, and grabbing the other brushes and an even longer wand from around the store, she put together my package. It was even a bit better than the original would have been, but it was no problem for her. She even threw in a package of replacement bags for the trouble. We ran the vacuum to see if it worked, and it did. 

As mentioned, I almost pinched myself to wake up from the dream. The level of customer service is outstanding here. It is like going back in time when people in general took pride in their work and had real work ethics.

There were 2 entrances, one closer the the T Moblie arena and 1 next to Sake Rok ( I think that's what it was?)  it was hectic and a little confusing since it was right before the Guns n Roses concert, it was pretty packed and there was no host/ess stand to seat you so we just walked right in, past the bar until we ran into the other entrance.  There was a little counter where you can order your food get assigned a buzzer and sit anywhere you can find a seat.  The only catch about ordering at this ""window"" is that you can only order the beer they had on tap at that particular area.  This included Citra Rye, not your father's root beer and one other I forget.   We order a beerhaus brat and an order of beer cheese pretzels which came up to about $14.  We then had to head over to the bar to order our beers.  I grabbed a table and waited for our buzzer to go off while the beers were being ordered.  For the beers we went with a Founders and a chocolate churro stout.  The Chocolate Churro stout was really good, but they are only allowed to fill the cup up about 3/4 up for this particular beer.

The food was A-Ok, the beer list had a good variety but a little pricey at costing about $22 for 2 beers, but at least the food came out pretty quick!

This show is located at the Mirage Hotel Casino. Featured in the movie ""Vegas Vacation"" This is where the ""Love"" show is at and the ambience is casual and cool.

I recommend getting there at least 30mins. early. That means you have given the ushers your tickets and you are deciding on what drink to get. I recommend ""Here comes the sun"" a tequila sunrise in a commemorative Beatles Cup a bit pricey like $20 or around that. You get a nice size drink and ""what the hay"" have something to remember the show by in addition to all the very cool memories. Plus the show is over a hour long and you might get thirsty.

This show has amazing energy and so many fantastic trapeze artists and acrobatics going on that you are bound to be smiling from ear to ear or be in complete ""awe"" for sure. Of course you will hear the Beatles music being played the entire time,but it is not being done by impersonators. The music is playing and the performers are putting on short stories, acts if you will. Cirque du Soleil is so amazing in almost everything they do in this show. With top notch performers it never disappoints. 5 star show :) Yay!!

 I cant wait to see the show again :) Now,every time I hear a song by the Beatles, I can picture the show and what was being done during that song. *smile... Ahh good times. 

We have been to ""Zumanity"" which was OK. I wouldn't go again, it just was not my thing. ""Mystere"" just irritated me with the big guy dressed like a baby. I dunno, I found it weird, grown man babbling like a baby in baby talk ,ugh, annoyed me and a waste of my time.*sigh Oh well to each their own, I guess.

In Las Vegas or coming to Las Vegas? Please check the times and schedule of The Beatles LOVE show as the performers do need their rest and take breaks. You will not be disappointed.

My husband and a group of friends were in town November 12-14th for the big boxing match up of Pacquiao vs Cotto. 
I know as much as most people know that when you go with a big group of friends- you are never in your room but a few hours to sleep, change, shower, and actually that's pretty much it. Had we brought our two kids it would be a different story. 

We stayed in their wide screen room in Tower 2. The wide screen rooms were completely renovated and looked really nice actually. Very sleek and modern. 
So we checked in pretty late on Thursday night, nearly 11pm. We then dropped off our luggage and met up with friends. When we got back to our room at 430 am we noticed there was no remote control to the flat panel TV- again were in what they called the wide screen room. Not wanting to be charged for someone else taking a stupid hotel remote I quickly called to the desk to let them know and to bring one up. You would think that at 430 am on Friday morning they would be quick to bring it up. NOOO... I called twice once at 450 in which they replied it would be any minute now, then again at 515 to try and cancel it since I was falling asleep- to which they replied they couldn't stop him since he had been dispatched already- REALLY? you couldn't get on the walkie talkie think he was obviously carrying with him to tell him the guests were asleep?!?! nope.. nada.. didn't happen my friends- 535am and ""POUND POUND POUND"" not even a gentle know but an angry pound pound pound... quickly got me to the door where a not so friendly bellboy shoved the remote in my hand and quickly left... WTF.. so of course I went down the next day and complained.. and they were nice enough to refund that whole night to me... and I got comped for food.. yay... 
The buffet was okay.. the drink service was great. I was on a budget and this place fit perfectly into it.

We ordered the sopressata pizza, the short rib pasta, and the lobster and rock shrimp pasta. The slices of mozzarella on the pizza wasn't melted on the pizza and was actually so heavy and still in it's original form that it slid right off due to its weight. The 'short rib' pasta that I had just looked, felt, and tasted like it was just ground beef. The taste wasn't anything memorable,until I realized it tasted just like Chef Boyardee (I went through a scary but so satisfying canned food phase in middle school). Pasta wasn't cooked all the way either. The lobster and rock shrimp was pretty good, but not a dish to order if you're hungry as portions were pretty small. 

In essence, this is the probably one of the few places where I left food on my plate and didn't ask for a to-go box.

Our family of 6 came for dinner on Christmas night.  We had the house special fish, fried chicken, salt & pepper tofu, special seafood-tofu pot, sautéed green beans and sautéed Chinese spinach.  The food was below average - the fish was mushy and not very fresh, and the fried tofu was over done.  A large number of our family lives in the San Gabriel Valley in Los Angeles, CA, so we know good Chinese and Vietnamese food.  This restaurant would never make it in the SGV.

Worst of all, the cashier/management was highly unethical.  Our dinner was around $90, and the itemized receipt, which added in both tax of about $10 and a 15% service charge of about $14, came to just over $114.  We provided a credit card, and when the charge slip came, the ""new total"" was $144, an extra $30 higher!!!   The itemized receipt was also gone from the little folio.

We went up to the cashier counter to ask a for copy of the itemized receipt again, and sure enough, the tip was already in the original total of $114, and the $30 was secretly added on.  When we pointed this out to the cashiers, we weee quickly told, ""Oh, this was a typo, we will cancel this charge and issue you a corrected charge slip.""  No apologies.

Anyone who's set up shop in this particular strip mall owes kickback to both internet foodies and Lotus of Siam. No tourists are going to come to this area and stick around unless they've got the safety of the herd to assuage their fears. There's nothing rational about pulling into a place that houses an Adult Day Care center, several seedy karaoke bars, and other storefronts that look unsavory enough that if someone told you they were a swingers' club or a brothel, you would absolutely take them at their word.

The owners of the place seem to understand that the internet is basically the hand that feeds them, so they advertise a free beer if you check in. Good on them. 

Cornish Pasty Co. is catty-corner to the front door of Lotus of Siam. If you exit Lotus and look out the front, it's the first shop in that closest line of shops on your left. (Two stores further up is a Thai food place whose passive-aggressive call out to potential customers reads, ""You'll Never Know If You Don't Try It."" I find that I cannot argue with this statement...)

Seating inside consists of a few tables, a few benches, and seats at the bar. This was a British-style eatery, so I opted for the bar. We ordered some draft beers and appetizers. My friend opted for the Scotch egg, I went with the oven-baked chips with garlic, and the third member of our group for the oven-baked red potatoes.

You can probably safely pass on both of the potato products and not feel like you missed out on anything. The Scotch egg, however, what pretty awesome. Sausage and eggs are great, sausage and hardboiled eggs are also great. Unlike other places I've had this, they serve the egg quartered which makes it much easier to eat and enjoy.

I opted with the Meat & Cheese pasty, which is sausage and cheese inside a pastry shell. I love pretty much all pies, meat or otherwise, and this was no different. The red wine gravy was an excellent, rich complement to the pasty. I might consider bringing an ice chest the next time I'm up here and getting a couple to take back to California.

Filling, reasonably priced, and delicious.

Chicken parm sandwich, but without the bread. IT WAS HUGE! Two massive chicken cutlets enough to function as an entree. It ended up being two meals for me. It comes with fries or chips, but server was nice enough to sub in a big garden salad for me, with their addictively-tasty Italian dressing. Ordered a meatball with the salad (salad + meatball equated to my lunch there, rest of the order was to-go). The last item was the lasagna. Again, two meals from it. Everything delicious and would definitely re-order again, all of it.

Let me start by saying that I hesitated to even set foot in your Las Vegas Store due to an overwhelmingly negative reviews that I have encountered online when we were looking to purchase a King Bed. My husband and I went to pretty much all the furniture stores here in Vegas looking for that 'ideal bed' for our brand new home. We found 'our bed' after three days of bed shopping at Ashley. Our sales agent DAVID YANES was simply awesome! He was very patient with us, very thorough with the details and was very easy and pleasant to work with! What I love about this store is the 'no-haggle policy'. No one was following you and you're free to roam around without being hounded. Although we found 'our ideal  bed', I was still a bit of a skeptic if I should make my purchase at Ashley Furniture but I followed my gut feeling and just went for it. Having to deal with the public every day, I know that people tend to only write more about their negative views and seldom discuss about their positive experiences. Well, I'M SO GLAD THAT I MADE THIS PURCHASE WITH ASHLEY FURNITURE!. Not only that my bed is so beautifully made and well-crafted with an unbelievably insane price compared to RCW and WF  but my experience from the time I visited the store, to meeting up with a great salesman David, having courtesy calls from Customer Service prior to the delivery date, the spot-on delivery service and installation up to the gentleman that has to fix some minor defects after the bed installation was just amazing!!!  Everybody went above and beyond their duty! I am very pleased with my purchase and looking forward to buy more furniture pieces in the future.

Again, I want to give a shout-out to David Yanes and his team at Ashley W. Sahara branch for a job well done and making me a very happy customer!!! Special mention to those 2 gentlemen that delivered and installed my very heavy, solid wood King Bed in the 112 degree heat here in Vegas and going up and down my 2-story home, the gentleman that did the minor repair and the impressive service I received from Customer Service! KUDOS to all of you...

Well most of his reviews and the one I read his most likely a good doctor. Made an appointment, got there 15 mins early however got called after 1 1/2 hour :( , took me into the room, questions me why I'm there . Doctor came in , asked me again what's the problem ( can't he looked in my chart what's the problem ? Since I told one of the med assistant?) 
To make it short, the med assistant came in and the Doctor telling me to apply this and that without telling me how much it's cost. He never even examine my problem , he's like four feet away . After being said and done in few minutes, told me to come back in a month. Went to their cashier Bought this kit worth $80,thought of trying since expensive!
Went to Walgreens and picked up the one they prescribed. One of the meds they prescribed worth $200 and they never even explain it to me in the office how much it's cost! And insurance won't cover it! 
The Pharmacist told me that they have to call the doctors office and ask for the authorization because insurance won't issue it and it'll take like a week to wait.I said why they won't cover it it's a prescribed meds and doctor has signed it. So I called the office and told them what the pharmacist had told me. So I waited and waited til I went back to my next appointment. Went there early and hoping they'll call me early. As I expected got called after an hour or so and I was tired for waiting since I came from my work. 
They took me in , doctor came in, see my problem and said oh most of it are gone and I said that there's one here that's still here and he told me oh I'll inject with this and should be gone in 4 weeks! And If that still be there then I'll do a minor cut . So I just said okay politely.
Went to their billing, whoa!!!without explaining she told me had to pay $150, she never explained why I'm paying for amount. I didn't go there for cosmetic, you mean that simple and tiny injection worth $150? That's ridiculous!! Plus I have insurance. What happened to my insurance? Can at least they'll explain it? 
Been to this dermatologist in Hawaii for 17 years and had no problem with this doctor. She even gave me a sample to start with. She even checked my problem although its visible for her in my fist visit.She made sure I understand every procedure. She spent time checking my problem. And I didn't stay and waited that long. For entire appointment took only 40 minutes! At their billing? They explained everything what and not the insurance covered. This dermatologist name is Carla Nip-Sakamoto. She's really a great and good doctor to be with. That's why I stayed with her for 17 years and I didn't go anywhere. After my first visit just went back after 6 months then a year just to follow up everything.
I guess I need to find another derm doctor.",6/5/2016 15:14,36.0768235,-115.1015041,6235 S Pecos Rd,NV,Las Vegas,89120,"Food Delivery Services, Food, Caterers, Event Planning & Services",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,AUNTY HELEN'S KITCHEN

The atmosphere was terrific even though it was very busy. I was surprised to read some recent unfavorable reviews but I come to my own conclusions. The only odd thing was what the hostess said to me when I came in. I had a reservation for one, told her my name and she asked me if I wanted a table?? Odd, because I don't believe I would make a reservation if I didn't want a table. She said, ""single people usually sit at the bar."" The girl was probably about 18 yrs. old. Move on. I was seated quickly and my server came by to get my drink order. I had the Morton's Cosmo which was yummy. I ordered the Bibb Lettuce salad which was very good, I ordered the bone-in ribeye and sautéed spinach and mushrooms. My steak was prepared perfectly and the spinach and mushrooms were amazing. I didn't need dessert and there was no way I could have eaten another bite, so I ordered the carrot cake to go. I read a recent review that said the carrot cake was small but I can tell you, that is definitely wrong. My piece has to weigh well over a pound. My experience was marvelous as I expected. I do not understand or agree with the slightly negative reviews. I hope other potential diners do not pay attention to those reviews. Visit Morton's and see for yourself.

Outside - fairly new building. Check out my photo from the parking lot.  

Sign-in - the  Dude (I forget his name), said about a 45 minute wait.  I thought - well,  if Yelpers say it's 4.5 stars,  it's got to be worth the wait.  So wait we shall.

25 minutes later, my party already had our table.  Yay!

Atmosphere - I love the checkerboard floors that make it seem like you're in a diner, but with a truly open floor plan.  You see everyone.  There's no hiding inside Mr. Mama's, so anyone fooling around in Vegas will probably avoid this place.  Hahaha, and that's one of the reasons I love it.  Even with all the noise, it's all good.  It's exciting seeing what everyone else got, too.  Makes you more hungry. 

Food - OMG!  I got the Mama's Stack which comes with 3 pancakes.  Everything on that plate was awesome.  My tween son had the Spanish omelette. I didn't try it, but what I did try was the french fries on his plate.  They're so cute cubed up that all that time i thought they were hash browns. And they tasted sooo good.. 

Service - very impressed.  Even though it was a packed house,  food came in out in 15 minutes tops. And not just us, seems everyone else too.  Our server, gal that looks like Selena Gomez, was very friendly and attentive.  She checked on us every 5 minutes.  Kat, the  manager, circled around checking on everyone.  Seriously, I don't think I've ever gotten that kind of attention from a breakfast joint anywhere.  

My only complaint, which I shared with Kat - was the fact that they have only 2 restroom stalls, a men and a women.  Since this place looks like it's going to be or continue to be the next big thing in Vegas, we should have at least 2 stalls for each sex, in case one gets tied down.  And you know that happens...  

Lastly, my only hope is that they do not grow too big.  Meaning they don't make too many locations.  Keep it original and stay as is.  Don't oversaturate the market.

Well, to be fair, we came here after a beer sampling session at Khoury's.  We had just finished drinking some of the finest beers available in Vegas (and some not available in Vegas).  

To drink I had the house brown ale.  It was sweet, dark, and very malty.  There was a strange chemical taste to it as well, perhaps.  I tried some of my friend's stout, and it was also pretty mediocre.  His description of this stout is classic, ""It reminds me of Pirates of the Caribbean.""  What a great description, ha!  However bad the brewery is here, the guest beer selection is amazingly great, and completely makes up for it.  

If you aren't a beer drinker, the food here is worth having too.  I had the shrimp pasta, and loved it entirely.  It was more dry than typical restaurant pastas, which I loved because the sauces these places use usually get gross after a while.  I could eat this pasta all day.  It might have been a little over priced, but I didn't mind at all.  My friend had a big deep dish pizza.  I didn't try any, but it looked delicious (and he confirmed this for me).  We also had the potato skins as an appetizer, and again a huge hit.  These were big thick potato chunks with skin, along with bacon and cheese.  Yummy.  They came with ranch and sour cream sauces.

A little expensive, and the house brewery didn't impress me (as a craft beer drinker), but the guest beer selection was great.  The food was definitely top notch for a hipster type restaurant.

Seriously, I should've walked out after they shut me down on THREE dishes.  Nope, that would upset my mom and auntie.  So, I had to sit through it and eat other dishes that I didn't care for.  Their tea was horrible - it was full of tiny, flavorless tea leaves.  It was undrinkable.

Their food was ok but, their practices were shady.  Telling us they're ""out"" of certain dishes and pushing other dishes on us.

Hj_XIduahlvvD0Wkj-TL7g,y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,oEkOj9NXJFrjFn3NBB_jpA,1,5,4,0,"Had a groupon for this place. First walked in, had a sinking feeling that I was in an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. The place is so big, didn't know where to go. Hostess sat us down, place was kind of empty. More of those nightmares starting to creep in.

You walk in and you already smell desperation. Not from the servers. The service was fine overall. Just that the place didn't know what it wanted to be. It's trying real hard to be fancy. Waiters with the vests, white linen, wine pairings, candles on the table, music you'd hear waiting for the weather on the 8's on the weather channel plays. It just didn't feel like it connected. This is supposed to be New Orleans style cuisine. I'm expected a party, some jazz, some energy and I got...elevator music? Kitchen....nightmares....

Food. The hushpuppies were fine. Bread was old, dry and flaky. The gumbo was not good. It was microwaved as the middle was molten hot and the outside was luke warm at best. Crab inside was fishy. Hardly any sausage. The Crab Cake Elaine was a travesty. Crab Cake over seasoned AND burnt, etouffe tasted strange. The red beans and rice was the worst I've ever had, over cooked and flat out gross. Brussel sprouts came out cold. The Mac and Cheese was also Microwaved AND overcooked. Hardly resembled Mac or Cheese. Kitchen...nightmares....

Spoke with waiter (Rob) and told him we were not happy with what we got. Traded mac and cheese with mashed potatoes and got the shrimp kabob appetizer instead. Waiter informed us that there was a rookie chef in the kitchen and that it was obvious that the crabcake was overcooked. Kitchen...nightmares...

The mashed potatoes were okay, which is saying a lot for how this meal was going. There were bits of garlic in there, which was nice. Sucked that the mashed potatoes were still really lumpy. The shrimp kabobs were strange as well. It was obviously overcooked on one side, charred to hell. My first bite was grittier than all hell. Think that the sauce got burnt on that. The rice pilaf was better than the red beans and rice, but that's like saying the Jets right now are better than the Raiders. Ain't saying much. The rice pilaf was still overcooked and watery. Brussell sprouts again and this time i just unraveled them and they were just stone cold in the middle. Kitchen...nightmares....

Before I even finished eating there, my stomach hurt. It must have known that it was going to pay too much money for this type of food. I left a comment card on there and I did tell them that I could pay $2.50 for Stouffer's and be eating that while watching Breaking Bad in my underwear. It didn't make sense to have the waiters act like this place is some high dining establishment when they can't be bothered to have decent soup or even make mac and cheese. Kitchen...nightmares...

The server was nice, didn't want to send food back, but it was really the worst food I've had in a long time. It was awful. I'm so glad I tried to stick to things that would get me too sick. The rookie chef thing might be true or it could just be an excuse on why mac and cheese is getting microwaved. Whatever it is, it shouldn't be happening.

We've been Las Vegas residents for decades...and Ferraro's is one of our very favorite restaurants in town.  The environment is both very elegant and welcoming...you can absolutely let your hair down and have a great time, while being certain that everyone who works there is a professional. I read with great interest the comment posted by ""Mike N"" on 11/22....it stands out as such an anomoly among the reviews of this restaurant....and it always makes my ears perks up when someone says he never writes a review, then proceeds  to write a really negative one!  Some people only speak up when they have something negative to say...and for people like that, almost everything they say IS negative.  

I am very glad to see that the overwhelming majority of reviewers are commenting on both the outstanding service and food -- beause that's what Ferraro's has.  We've been enjoying this restaurant since its former location on the West side...it is one of our highlights in the city.  My husband and I eat at Ferraro's at least once a week...and I can assure you that Walter and Piero, as well as the GM, Adam, Mimmo, Gino, Jeff, Rick, Ali, and everyone else are 100% professionals. We have truly never had an experience there that wasn't amazing...and we've had lots of experiences!!!  The osso bucco, halibut, sea bass, filet, raviolo (just to name a few) are on our frequent flyer list...as well as many appetizers that I won't mention because I don't know the proper Italian spelling.

The osso bucco really is the very best I've ever had. Lobster diablo is another top 5....the list goes on and on. jThe extensive and reasonably priced wine list is also a plus.

PizzaRev isn't the best customizable pizza chain, but it's the cheapest on one particular day of the week. I'm always willing to wait around for Tuesday, and until now, it's always been a quick drive to one near my home. On this Tuesday, however, I was on the Strip with a friend, and he reacted eagerly when I brought up the idea, so we dropped in for a late dinner.

I was surprised that there were barely any other customers inside, and that's in absolute terms, not just relative to the massive, open-plenum dining room and reasonable, fenced-in outdoor patio. I know it's a weekday, the weather is finally cooling, and the location is not really on the Strip, but I figured that it's central enough that it would be more well-trafficked than it was.

End result: it ended up being one of the fastest pizza line experiences in recent memory because we (1) barely had anybody in line ahead of us and (2) the employees were fast and not perpetually hesitant like most of the Henderson PizzaRev folks seem to be.

Unless you're boring and willing to settle for their preset topping combos, you're gonna want to go wild to get the most out of your money. Start with the signature thin crust ($7.99 normally, and goes down to $6.00 on Tuesdays) unless you want to pay a $1.30 premium for double dough or gluten-free. Afterward, slowly walk down the line as they ask for your desired ingredients in this order: sauce (they'll mix sauces if desired, but I'm usually fine with just one), cheese, veggies, and meats (an odd switcheroo from the meats-then-veggies order of Henderson and of other chains). Then pay and either wait for a to-go order or find yourself a seat.

I experienced some mixed surprises at this point. The pleasant surprise was that an employee actually brought the post-oven pizzas over to our table, rather than calling us to the counter to pick up the dine-in orders as I've seen in other similar stores. The unfortunate surprise was that they were entirely out of their PizzaRev-branded sauces save for Jalapeño. Where are the Mango Bonney or Chipotle sauces that would've elevated my bites? What about something like Peach Vidalia or Datil Pepper or even the dreaded Ghost Pepper? No? Well, I wasn't feeling the urge to toss on some Cholula or Sriracha, so I ultimately passed.

Fortunately, they did have the pesto drizzle which I've found to be a near-staple (you may wanna ask before the end of the line about this, due to their unusual level of service), as well as some dried oregano and plenty of chili pepper flakes. These played well enough with my sufficiently crispy cracker-esque crust, (mildly) spicy red sauce, array of cheeses (mozzarella, bleu, and ricotta for me), and copious amounts of veggies and meats to make the pizza a satisfying meal.

I should add a couple more notes on their downsides, lest the insufficient sauce supply wasn't enough to justify the downgrade. Most importantly to newbies, they had zero labels for anything beyond the sauce. It was an issue for my friend, but fortunately, I'm so experienced that I don't just recognize toppings on sight, but also (probably) can recite my typical order by memory. The other concern, a nitpick at best, is that they might be just a tad less generous on toppings than at least the Henderson location; maybe they're used to people like me? I'll have to pay more attention if I can so that I can ask for a 1.5x or double helping of one or two things.

PizzaRev is an awesome chain on Tuesdays, and they're not too shabby on other days of the week. I've got work tomorrow, so I'll have to come back to this unique location when I have a better opportunity to try the self-serve taproom (pricing determined with the aid of RFID or NFC or whatever fancy tech they have in those wristbands). I probably will continue to breeze past the Craft Your Own salads, but maybe you won't?",11/15/2017 7:33,36.0686726,-115.0695301,2021 W Sunset Rd,NV,Henderson,89014,"Mexican, Restaurants",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Sanchos's Mexican Grill

Soooo took my car in for check engine light.  They called, explained what the (at the time) problem was and recommended some other things.  OK how much?  Oh boy.  Oh well. Get it done!
Marco was kind enough to drop me off at work (thanks Marco) and pick me up as well.  
Get my car, things are running smoothly.  Friday got off early, was going to stop at the casino to put in a bet and BOOM....wouldn't you know it.  Check engine light is back on.  (guess I wasn't supposed to bet that day lol) I called and they said bring it in.  They ran another diagnostic.  This time the throttle body or something was bad.  They tried to clean it to save me some money but that did not work.  Actually the cleaning made it worse.  They kept my car and offered me a loaner car (thanks again).  They had my car all weekend and finally Tuesday night they called to tell me it was ready.  I had just met my family from out of town for dinner so I said I will swing by in the am.  Got my car Wednesday am.  Work is literally 6 minutes down the road so I didn't get to give it a good test run.  Thursday, car running great.  Friday (personal time taken off to be w the fam) I hop in to go and meet the fam at dad's timeshare and 10 minutes into the car ride........here we go again w the check engine.  This time....thermostat.  Lordy, I'm broke now.  Hell I was broke before but now I'm really REALLY broke lol.
Marco made sure to bring me back to show me the reading on the machine reader for the code (appreciate ya).
It's been 5 1/2 days and so far we are looking good.  Jack even called yesterday to see how everything was going.  
NOW....Let's be clear.  The check engine light repeatedly coming on had nothing to do with the work that they had performed.  Each time it was something different.  I was confused, like why won't it just give ALL the codes at once but Jack and Marco patiently explained to me that it just doesn't work that way, especially for older cars.  I've trusted this place since I first met Hamid and now dealing with Marco and Jack for what was every other day, I trust them as well.
Fellas and the mechanic that worked hard on my car, I appreciate you!  Thank you for being patient with my frustrations and my confusion and thank you so much for working with me!

The manager looked it all up and had my receipt RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM ON THE COMPUTER but refused to exchange it for me even though I only bought them a few days prior. I wasn't asking for a refund just simply asking for the correct brakes I should of got in the first place. He still refused.

I was very appalled. I told him my proof of purchase is right in front of him on the computer and all I wanted was the right brakes that go to my car!

I never got his name but he's an old man that probably should be getting ready for retirement for the simple fact he didn't know how to do his job and accuses customers of stealing.. I work retail myself, since when do we blatantly accuse customers of stealing? 

Went down to the original location that I got the wrong brakes from. The young manager there with the gauges was wonderful and apologized for my horrible experience at this piece of shit Sahara location and just simply exchange my brakes for the correct was. I didn't get his name either but he was a young fella and really handsome lol.

Definitely not worth its claim.  Yes, it has toasted artisan bread, but it has some unique sandwiches, but nothing worth raving about.

Maybe I was just expecting too much, or maybe most people who have reviewed this have never had a sandwich with artisan bread, but it was a pretty mediocre sandwich.

I tried both the Full montagu and the hawaiian one.

Both were similarly unimpressive.

Could've used an extra slice of meat to balance out the thickness of the bread.  Don't get me wrong -- the bread was good... though it would've been nice to have more variety.  But then it's not really my way.  The sandwiches are pretty much done as an assembly line so there's not customization.

I was having difficult time request my order today, because there's this noodle soup I really want to try but it's super spicy, so I asked the waiter if they can make it less spicy, the waiter immediately responded with an attitude ""No we can't"", so I asked again, if they can just mix other soup with it or less chilly oil or do whatever they can to make it less spicy, he still shakes his head  and say ""No, the soup is spicy already"", I can't stand restaurant don't even showing ANY EFFORT trying to accommodate the customers, I get it, maybe they really can't do it, but they can't even respond nicely and said ""I will ask the chef for you"", what kind of horrible attitude and huge ego was that? their soup isn't even good at all, WAY TOO SWEET, almost like they dumped bunch of sugar in there.

No calls, from anyone, to discuss.  I go in today, 2/13/17, almost a full 2 weeks later, the bright green zippers are still on the jackets.

Twice my girlfriend and I came for birthday celebration and twice did they ruin the celebration. 

2014 - we tried to get an extended stay in the wee hours of Vegas morning. We called the front desk and also went down to the front desk in person to try to extend our room but they could not help us. They told us to check out and wait at the lobby and try to check in at a later time saying that the room has been pre-booked by someone else even though there are other rooms of the same type available to check in after 3pm. We tried calling other hotels but they were booked full. We tried one last time to call the front desk to help extend our room and finally they extended the room for us and switched the other reservation to another room of the same type after following our simple suggestion. We spent 2-3 hours packing and calling other hotels at 4am when such an easy job could have been done way earlier. 

A complaint was made to Marriott and Marriott were at least kind enough to give us an apology and had forwarded the complaint email to Cosmopolitan for them to take care. What did they do? Nothing. Not even an email of apology. 

2015 - the credit card on file had a problem during our stay because of a security breach found by the bank and transactions in the hotel had been declined due to that. I received a temporary card and had hoped to change the card on file to the temporary card even though we know that it is most likely not accepted but we tried anyway because I did not want my girlfriend to be paying for the stay in Vegas for her own birthday celebration. I begged the front desk to see if there is anything he can do to help us and he said, ""Who is to say that you did not pick this from the ground and try to use it."" Really? Is that customer appreciation and care? Accusing customers of being a thief? There are many other ways to decline the temporary card to show understanding and care for the customers. 

It is a shame that I am not recommending this hotel because all other back of house (operators, cleaners, maintenance) were very kind and nice but yet few front of house people just ruin every hopes and dreams.

We brought our dog who is a yorkie/schnauzer to go hiking with us because the previous yelp reviews suggested that the trails are well suited for dogs. 

I would have to completely disagree. 

The cactus' on the overlook trail were dropping spiny pods all over the ground and if your dog deviated even slightly off the path they could easily pick those up and unfortunately for my dog he had 4 huge cactus pods stuck in every single one of his pads. He couldn't walk because they were so painful so every couple of feet he would start limping, I would go check his pads, remove the cactus spines and this continued over and over. 

Again, we were on the overlook trail and decided that we should turn back and walk the grounds. That was a relief for his sweet feet and it was nicely shaded so we got some relief from the sun.

It's interesting how many people do not understand the difference between wet and dry bbq. Barbecue preference is largely dictated by whether you like saucy or seasoned meat  Dry barbecue is smoked, while the wet variety is usually cooked in a fire pit. 
As they say, the secret is in the sauce. Or the rub. And Big Ern uses both which are also homemade. Rubs are typically worked into the meat the night before it's cooked so that the salt can penetrate the cut and tenderize it. But rubs do more than flavor and soften the meat; they also enhance its texture by caramelizing and forming a crispy crust when cooked. Because of the rub's ability to penetrate the meat, fatty cuts like brisket respond well to this type of seasoning. Memphis BBQ is typically a dry barbecue with sauce on the side; in Kansas City and North Carolina, people like their barbecue wet with even more sauce on the side. 

The service is great, and I have been lucky to sit inside on all my visits, because of the temperatures, but, I am sure that the heaters would be turned on, if needed.

The price to some may be steep, however, go to any fast food restaurant and up-size that meal, and see what you'll pay for heart-attack in a box.
I only have one negative remark and it's to Lonely D who reviewed on 12/23, I understand that the holidays may be lonely for some, but one who is unemployed, was a 3 meat combo really necessary, if you couldn't really afford it?

Ok, another remark to Lonely D. Sorry. French fries, really? i just googled Southern BBQ side dishes and the most common sides are available at Big Ern's. Only one out of 10 sites even listed ""oven-fried"" fries, as a side dish. So I guess, the next time you want to take a ""suicidal"" trip, try McDonald's, i hear they have a form of ""rib"" sandwich (now this is not meant for human consumption).

Big Ern's BBQ is small (meaning a one store location), but a HUGE success!!",1/2/2014 4:15,36.2392819,-115.0592898,4350 N Nellis Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89115,"Shopping, Mobile Phones, Drugstores, Food, Grocery, Department Stores, Discount Store, Fashion",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,Shopping,,,Restaurants_FoodShopping,Walmart Supercenter

I've actually been to the real restaurant on the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France and this was a nice replica! Obviously the view in Paris doesn't compare but for Vegas standards it's pretty good.

I made reservations here on Open Table for a party of 7 for my sister's bachelorette party. You will need to put a credit card down to reserve here.If you make reservations and cancel less than 24 hours before, you will be charged $50 per person cancellation fee. 

There are breathtaking views of the Bellagio Hotel and fountains. It definitely has that romantic feel. The window seats are reserved for parties of 2. 

Upon seating a server comes out with a try of assorted breads: whole grain, white, French etc. and you can select as many as you like.

What to order:
 Pink Velvet Cocktail $19- My sister ordered this and it was so delicious! Perfect girly drink! I liked it better than the Eiffel Tower Affair cocktail that I ordered

Eiffel Tower Affair Cocktail $19- I prefer the pink velvet, but this wasn't bad either. It's pretty much a sangria.

Crispy Loup de Mer- Tasted divine! I like that it wasn't heavy and you won't feel bloated after eating this.

Nutella Souffle $16- YOU MUST GET A SOUFFLE! This was incredibly delicious! It almost tastes like an egg custard! I wish I were eating this right now!

There's a restaurant photographer that will come around and take photos for you and you can purchase a souvenir photo for $25.

I originally downloaded the app Booksy which is a booking app to set up appointments with barbers and other professionals in the area. I booked an appointment with Nikko at Sin City Cutz as this location is next to my house.

I walked in about 15 minutes because I didn't want to be late to a place I've never been to and potentially miss an appointment that was scheduled. The barber shop atmosphere is what you would expect, busy environment where there is music playing, the football game was on tv, and if you didn't have an appointment set up you'd probably be waiting for awhile.

I had no idea what Nikko looked at the time when I booked and vice versa. When it came time for my appointment he texted me (had my number from making the appointment on Booksy) asking if I was still on for the appointment. I replied and said I was up in the front and wasn't sure what he looked like so I just waited for him to get me. He introduced himself to me and showed me to the chair.

When it comes to haircuts I can either have what I want in mind or am willing to try something new. He asked what I wanted and I decided to go with getting a fauxhawk as that is what I've been getting for a haircut. Throughout the session we went on talking about life, interests, plans for the future, etc. Conversation felt natural and was able to keep it going throughout the cut.

The end result is what I wanted. The fade was clean and no stray hairs were found. The fauxhawk was shaped well and wasn't too long.

We've done Crossfit for 3 months and 10 months, respectively. This is one of the best boxes I've dropped into, by far. Everyone at CFA welcomed us with open arms and immediately made us feel like a part of their community. The athletes are clearly very fit (evidence of good programming!), and every one of them is kind, fun to work with, and great to talk to. The coaching is probably the strongest part of this box though. The coaches I had the pleasure of working with (Wes and Monica) took the time to work with us as if we were regulars, and even helped myself and my boyfriend achieve a few skills we've been working to get over the past few weeks. They explain each skill fully, ensure that novice and expert alike are challenged, and push you to perform your best. Not to mention that the equipment and rigs and whatnot at the box are phenomenal!! If you're in Vegas looking for a box to drop into or to call home, definitely go to CFA.

Maybe it is the fact that they can only seat 60 people and it causes a bottleneck at the front door. The wait times can be unreasonable, but that does not detract from the food. 

It has been almost three years since I have last had a chance to eat at Ichiza. Yet again, we came to see that they had almost been filled to capacity. 10 minutes later we were sat. Count it as a blessing if that is all you have to wait. The seats at the bar is perfect for two and would make for a great date spot. Although you might be inches away from the next patron, everyone is more wrapped up in their own conversation and lives. There is no need to feel self-conscious. 

The buta-kimchi is similar to a spicy pork dish popular in Korea. Mixed with kimchi and served on a bed of finely shredded cabbage made for a light dish. The garlic chicken gizzard is so simple and that makes it that much better. Add a squeeze of lemon and you will roll up the lettuce garnish to eat it all. Check the specials board and print out because hidden gems are bound to make an appearance. Yesterday, they had a blue fin tuna mix with micro greens on top of half an avocado. DECADENCE! They were not done yet. Add a quail egg to it and call it a day. Don't forget to save room for dessert, because everyone needs a little honey toast in their lives. So many places try to make a name for themselves off this dish, but not many can match Ichiza.

There's a buffet-style bar for veggies and seafood for you to choose to take back to your table and cook as well as another area where you can choose your own sauce.

I understand this place is new, but their greatest downfall was service/efficiency. Orders were constantly sent to the wrong table. We thought it was just our table but seemed to be happening to everyone around us. Tables are numbered, so I'm not sure where the miscommunication is happening. We would get things that weren't ours, incomplete, or just not at all...all night. Our server, Irene, was very sweet though and apologetic. She was only taking our order and wasn't the one carrying it out.

Is it sad that one main reason we planned this trip to Vegas (other than to take a vacation) is to try out the Buffet of Buffets?  It is - OK, that's what I thought.  =)  

However, if you think about it, you will get your money's worth - even if you do not normally eat several buffets.  The cost per person is ~$50 ($5 off if you're a Total Rewards member) for 24 hours - if you ate 3 regular meals, you'd easily spend that much money on food (unless every meal was at McDonald's or Del Taco).  If at least one of those meals was at a buffet, the cost is anywhere from $25-$40 on average so it's definitely a good deal.  Some people say that they can't eat THAT much food and to them I say - don't eat that much food.  Only eat what you want at each meal and don't feel the need to stuff yourself.  The bf and I wanted to try as many buffets as possible in the 24 hours (which our stomachs later regretted).  We got to five buffets out of seven (the Flamingo buffet was closed & we did not go to Imperial Palace due to very poor reviews). 

1) Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood - 4:15pm) = we arrived & went straight to the buffet. =)  It was a smart move because there was no line at this time and we were able to fit in another buffet later in the evening.  Years ago, this was my favorite buffet but in recent times, it has faded.  The food here is decent and there's many international choices (Asian, Mexican, Italian, Mediterranean, American) but nothing really stood out as fantastic.  The best part of the buffet is the desserts - the best selection of all buffets which included flan & creme brulee (my favorites) and cotton candy to take with you. =)

2) Lago Buffet (Caesar's Palace - 8:30pm) = easily our least favorite buffet we went to.  You would think that Caesar's would have a wonderful, lavish buffet but it had the smallest selection.  We had to wait about 20 minutes and while waiting, I was really excited because the decor was very nice.  However, once inside, the food selection was sad - about one third that of a normal buffet.  Even the salad toppings and availability of fruit was poor - nothing here was good in our opinion.  The only positives I can see are a decent dessert section - lots of items available (although the same 6-8 items repeated frequently) and there's gelato.  

3) Le Village Buffet (Paris - 8am) = great choice for breakfast.  In my opinion it's hard to ruin breakfast but it's also hard to make breakfast interesting too.  I felt there were many different options for breakfast food items here that you may not see at other buffets.  Eggs included scrambles, omelettes, eggs benedict, fritattas...there were waffles, crepes, pancakes and french toast as well.  A variety of sausages, bacon, pastries and fruit made this buffet great.  Good bacon is important to me and here it was good. =)

4) Flavors Buffet (Harrah's - 11:30am) = better than expected!  Here you can expect familiar comfort foods that are done well.  Of all the buffets we went to, this was the only one that had fried chicken!  It's such a dumb thing to be excited over but I love fried chicken & it tasted great!  I also enjoyed baked potatoes, spicy tuna sushi, chow mein, flan and cotton candy here as well.  =)  Also a plus - gelato! =)

5) Carnival Buffet (Rio - 4pm) = our favorite of the five!  Although I do not think this buffet is the best in Las Vegas, this is definitely the best in our Buffet of Buffets list.  The variety here is fantastic - so many choices!  They also had the most cold crab legs available - definitely no waiting around for new crab legs to be brought out.  =)  I love that they have Mongolian BBQ and an Asian noodle soup bar which included pho, rice noodle soup, egg noodle soup, udon, wonton soup, hot/sour soup and egg flower soup.  Yum!  I really appreciate this because often the Asian food section consists of bad fried rice/chow mein, orange chicken and other Americanized versions of Asian food.  I think the dessert section is weak here but I'm not a dessert person anyway so this was fine with me.  =)

Overall, I think Buffet of Buffets is your best bet if you're trying to save some money on food - the best thing to do is to go early to each buffet to avoid standing in line.  I would do this again if we had no specific fancy plans for eating. =)",12/30/2011 7:41,36.0281773,-115.0490159,"27 S Stephanie St, Ste 100",NV,Henderson,89012,"Restaurants, Salad, Food, Pizza, Food Delivery Services",Restaurants,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Toppled Tortoise

The very FIRST thing the sales guy says is ''Oh, last years model, ok'' Then, when he doesn't get a response from me, he begins to ''let me know'' about the refresher rate (which I'd already seen and did not care about) and tell me that this 50'' Samsung t.v. Is ''fine for a guest room'' he just sucked all the joy out of my purchase. I told him fine, if he has another Samsung with a higher refresher rate for the same price, I'll gladly buy it so he tries to steer me towards other cheaper brands which he obviously has a higher profit margin on. He of course, could not find a Samsung and I no longer wanted to be there. It was the same slimy feeling you get dealing with used car salesmen. Yuck. I told him to forget it, I will buy it online somewhere.
Ended up buying a 55'' Samsung LED smart tv on sale at Target for 799! They even took it to my car to see if it would fit before I paid for it and then had to bring it back in and out again.

*The front desk is understaffed, so service there is slow.
*No guest laundry.
*The hotel is run down and the decor is very dated.  The hotel once had a Greek Isles theme, and some of this old decor is still around.  The outside of the hotel is done in a '70s gold and glitz style.  So the decor is very inconsistent.   
*Cabs do not wait here, so if you need a cab to get you over to the strip, call the front desk before you head downstairs and ask them to call one for you.  Cabs usually take about 5 minutes to get here.  A ride to the strip is 10-20 minutes depending on traffic and your destination. 
*The casino is deserted much of the time.  Don't expect to head down to the bar at the end of the day and find people to chat with.",2/25/2012 21:26,36.15949833,-115.1473491,910 Las Vegas Blvd S,NV,Las Vegas,89101,"Desserts, Seafood, American (Traditional), Restaurants, Mexican, Food",Restaurants,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Doña Maria Tamales Restaurant

Their chicken tikka masala was really good; the chicken was very flavorful, and the curry was just right.  It wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was high up there, and the chicken was just perfect.

We ordered some appetizers (the sampling platter with the somosas and a few other things), and they were all quite good as well.  The only thing I didn't like about them was they seemed to all be covered in a thin layer of salt.  It tasted great, but it was a bit salty.

Their home-made tamarind sauce was delicious and went well with the appetizers.

We also ordered a special eggplant dish that was also pretty good.  Gerald didn't care for it, but I thought it was tasty.

My bacon was a greasy, nasty crumbled mess and makes me ill just thinking of how awful the entire meal was. But I tried to eat it thinking people have their bad days. When enough was enough, I literally hadn't seen my mother in months who had been in town to meet me for food, and this is what I fed her? Nah. Not happening. I went inside with my plate and the owner was OFFENDED I had brought in the plate to explain my disappointment. She persisted to make excuses and not own her mistakes. Excuse after excuse and was completely offended. In this day and age, I feel people can get away with this SHIT but even though I swore I'd come back... that alone completely turned me off. Let alone, she needed to save face for the little article and photos of her establishment that was being done the very time we were there. God forbid I made a scene, and I had the decency not to do so with them there. I had every right to be disgusted with the food and her reaction to what I said. I don't give a rats ass if she paid for our breakfast. Her attitude set her apart from me ever coming back. And the lack of honor in her response to a HORRIBLE food service. Good luck with that attitude and know it all demeanor. I can BY FAR create a superior meal than what I was subjected to. And pay way less than $12 for near silver dollar pancakes and inedible, crumbled greasy ""organic"" $6 bacon, COLD toast and COLD poached eggs with a sloppy mess of a flavorless dish. It actually makes me angry writing this. And I never complain because I've been there. Take a footnote from my book, never make excuses.

We got tower 1 this past year and it has a private 21+ pool area so we make the trek to tower 2 pools. Starbucks is on the lobby level of tower 1. 

Our check-in experience was awesome. Every employee we have encountered every time has been pleasant and friendly- wishing us greetings and well as opening the doors for us. We've booked the one bedroom suite- the bedroom is separated from the living room area with a door and there is also a second bathroom with a shower in the living room area. The kitchen has a really nice full size subzero brand fridge. 

If you want any dinnerware and utensils, you have to request it through housekeeping. The first time we stayed here, everything was already stocked for us but not anymore. It was kinda annoying to have to call in my request for dishes and having to wait at most an hour. We also had to request a ""dishwashing kit""- which is a small bottle of dishwashing liquid and a large sponge in a little bag. Odd but ok. Also, we had to request a roll of paper towel as well. Again, a bit annoying but trivial. 

Housekeeping was amazing. The whirlpool tub was amazing. We just love this hotel and we will definitely be back for our next annual trip.",7/26/2016 14:56,36.1004963,-115.121475,2222 E Tropicana Ave,NV,Las Vegas,89119,"Italian, Restaurants",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Strings Italian Cafe

Their gyros have incredibly moist and tender meat, crisp veggies, yummy tzatziki and blanket soft pita bread. The feta fries are a great mix of crunchy, salty and tangy. Their rice bowls are really good too! 

If you come during busy times, you may have trouble finding seats. It can get packed as they only have limited seating inside. They do have an outdoor seating area but it's probably not the best during the summer. You know, Vegas heat. 

They have the whole Greek vibe going with the music and decor. You can call in orders for pick up as well. Friendly service every time.

-Beef tartare, a little creamy and spicy from the kimchi, interesting, not my favorite

-Strawberry Sticky Cake, really good, must order, on the sweeter side

We also ordered a scoop of the lemon thyme ice cream, but wouldn't have if we knew it came on the pie, server should have mentioned.  

Trendy beans, Stumptown, our espressos were just okay.

We reserved seating through OpenTable and got there about 15 minutes early. Most of the time you simply have to check in to the maître d' and then you can proceed to the bar or go somewhere at your comfort and wait typically with some modern method of alerting you via text or a vibrating notification device that you carry with you. But for whatever reason, Gordon Ramsay decided to put together a cheesy night club style line to somehow give others the impression that this establishment is worth more than the merits of quality of the food  alone.  But this fake line and people waiting in line make it 'seem' popular. This is just plain uncomfortable and with no regard to other people in the same line who do not have reservations . I asked the maître d'  if we could wait at the bar and be called from there, and they said 'no, you have to stand in a line'. This is absolutely ghetto and ridiculous for such a high level establishment that does have great food. Generally if you're going with a lady wearing high heels this is not a comfortable thing to impose upon her as a date or as a purveyor of fine foods. Just not classy at all. Come on Gordon, you're better than this. You don't need to post the false impression that your restaurant is so popular that you have long lines to get in. Leave those ghetto tactics to the cheesy nightclubs who aren't filled inside as they  try to make you think they are while making you wait. in the cold. Pretty sad.

2 adults and a teenager

Atmosphere - 4 stars
Food - 2 stars
Service - 1 star

Background - After a long day of driving from Reno we wanted Italian close to our hotel.

Atmosphere - The best thing going with this place.  Lofting ceilings with great colors covering the walls make for a warm inviting place.

Food
Appetizer - Free bread came in a small basket, it contained three triangular cracker thin bread slices covered in seasoning and a chuck of soft bread.  The cracker bread was seasoned, looked, and tasted like pizza.   They could have offered to bring more bread when it was gone.  If I was eating some pasta as my meal I would have liked it to arrive without me begging. 

Main Course - They did not have any stuffed pasta that I was interested in.  So I went with the sliced steak salad.  The steak was over peppered and the medallion pieces needed to be cut.  The lettuce was nothing special, mostly iceberg chopped into small squares.  The highlight of the meal was the candied pecans.  This comment you could put under service or here, the menu indicates that steak will be cooked to order.  The waiter  never asked and I forgot as it took a long time to place our meal order with him.

Dessert - skipped it  

Service - This was really lacking.  The floor was simply nasty.  Noodles all over the floor next to wear I sat.  As we sat there I noticed a Gatorade bottle on the floor next to me after the lady at the next table over placed in on the floor before they left.  The busy boy must have not noticed it as he kicked it under the table.  I typically only drink water with my meal now, and when you fill a 12 ounce glass completely with ice, you better be coming back with more water frequently.  But not the case here, only once was my water refilled, placing the glass at the edge of the table should all I have to do.   As we were finishing up our meal, a different bus boy took care of the other table next to us.  The table was covered in a table cloth.  When he placed the new one on the table it was like he was making a bed up and down with cloth.  I know it was a hot night but I really do not need a table cloth fan next to me.",7/4/2011 16:51,36.2112472,-115.2987804,"9320 Sun City Blvd, #101",NV,Las Vegas,89134,"Afghan, Restaurants",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Royal Kabob Restaurant

What is pocha? Pocha is short for ""pojangmacha"" which literally means covered wagon. We typically refer it as a tent nowadays and they are the terms used for street vendors. It refers more to the street vendors on the street that has a tent over them, which is really popular during the winters in Korea and typically really popular during the late nights. They serve appetizers, noodles, and soups. Different pochas will have different menus -- so pretty much like a restaurant. Whenever you eat at a pocha, there's is always liquor involved. If you've watched any Korean dramas, you have most likely seen one. It's usually the one tent place with chairs, tables, and the main actor/actress is getting drunk.There's actually not too many traditional pocha places in the big city anymore. They have mostly moved into brick and mortars now. 

Unfortunately at YasikNara, they don't have liquor available yet. I assume that they are waiting for their liquor license. Huge bummer because Korean late night foods is not the same without some beer and soju. 

YasikNara has an extensive selection on their menu. They range from your usual Korean dishes such as kimchi pancakes, ddukbokki (spicy rice cake), and fried chicken to your not-so-usual but traditional pocha dishes such as soondae (blood sausage), spicy chicken feet, and raw sea snails.  They even incorporated some fusion items like kimchi pasta into their menu. So no matter the type of Korean food you like, you'll definitely find them here. 

We decided to get an order of fried chicken $15, spicy chicken feet with fried rice $20, and stir fried chicken gizzard $15. The spicy chicken feet is located on their ""hot n spicy"" section of the menu and on this section, you are able to choose how spicy you want it, on a scale of 0-7. If you want an idea of how spicy is spicy, the waitress told us that 2 was a medium spicy. I'm an adventure go-er. If you've read my reviews, I am also a glutton for spicy pain. I can handle my heat and I will challenge the scale if you tell me your 2 is medium. But why is your scale so tilted? I asked what is the base to their spice levels -- was it gochujang (red pepper paste) or tons of peppers or what was it? She told me it was chili extracts. Well then.. from my personal experience on chili extracts, you don't want to fuck with it. My friend and I whimped out and decided to get a level 3 for it -- we weren't in the mood to have fiery butts. Keep in mind, the fried rice that you get with it uses the same sauce that the chicken feet comes in. 

The fried chicken came to the table first. They use a whole chicken for the dish and it's a pretty small chicken. It's probably the same size chickens as the ones you find at Greenland. They cut it in quarters for you, comes with shredded cabbage with thousand island, and it also has dipping salt for it. It actually reminded me of deep fried quail. The chicken itself was pretty decent and it was fried really well. However, it doesn't remind me of Korean fried chicken very much .. 

The spicy chicken feet was not boneless. There is a boneless version but it was $25 versus the $17, plus $3 for the rice. A level 3 spice is spicy. It hits you, lingers, and builds as you keep eating. I would probably compare it to a level 10 at a Thai restaurant. It was super delicious though and I wouldn't mind getting it again. However, I would prefer the boneless version but I don't think it's worth $25 for it. 

Lastly, the stir fried chicken gizzards. It came with two different types of dipping sauces: sesame oil with salt and pepper and something similar to Tabasco. The dish was okay .. I think I would have preferred it to have a bit more flavor. But then again, it could be because the chicken feet had a ton of flavor to it so everything else seemed a bit bland. 

I think YasikNara is a pretty decent place to grab some Korean dishes that you can't get anywhere else in this city. I honestly really enjoyed it. However, the only thing that is keeping me from coming back would be their price point. Their price point is entirely too high for what they are serving. I understand that they are a restaurant from LA but even for LA, those prices are a bit high. I am not sure if they're charging high prices because of how unique their dishes are but it's just not my cup of tea. I mean, they have french fries on the menu for $10, steamed egg for $10, and their sea snail dishes are $30. 

Three stars for their chicken feet and spice levels. I'll definitely come back if they can lower their prices.",1/9/2018 7:53,36.2023607,-115.1582806,2362 Lexington St,NV,Las Vegas,89106,"Restaurants, Burgers",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Hamburger City

We've watched for months as the sign illuminated their existence, but waited for the doors to actually open. 

Last weekend, The Husband, a friend, and I finally decided to see what the fuss was all about.  We sat down a little after 7 pm and each took a look at the spread before us.

There seemed to be a good amount of banchan to choose from, including white rice and purple rice.  Quite a selection of meats to choose from as well.  Their cooked items were okay - ranging from dumplings, fish, and tempura.  Their dessert selection though is something to cry about - jello, canned peaches, fresh watermelon and honeydew, old sesame balls, and deep-fried pineapple chunks.

Price for adults on weekends: $19.95

I do have to agree with other comments regarding the staff hounding you.  The managers would come by our table all the time (we were seated close to the register), and take a survey of the restaurant.  It made me wonder if they were watching how much we were eating.  At one point, the waitress put the bill on our table and I was a bit shocked.  I said ""Is there a time limit?"" under my breath, but she then told us to take our time.  (Take our time eating or take our time paying the bill?)  Either way, getting your bill during our meal is a bad sign.  Don't do it.  And yes, we also experience the older Korean owner too.  I guess I said something out loud about not having any lettuce, and a little green salad showed up at my table.  Weird.  

Service is okay - drinks come immediately, and they also help with cooking your meat too.  Our grill got cleaned once while we ate, which looked super easy because she just wiped it with a paper towel.

Overall, Sula BBQ Buffet was okay, I think there's a bigger selection over at Woo Che, and it's cheaper there too.",8/28/2009 10:40,36.1614844,-115.2442077,903 S Rainbow Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89145,"Restaurants, Chicken Wings",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Wingstop

yNjExurfIh8mrbucR7WXtw,olA3GvX3Zr10T63Y-7CGJw,eLFfWcdb7VkqNyTONksHiQ,4,3,3,3,"6 super hungry friends at an all you can eat Korean BBQ during a holiday lunch rush and one insanely busy (yet somehow organized) waiter named Ozzy! We literally ordered everything off of the menu that was available for lunch, which only excluded beef tongue and maybe one or two other items. Lunch also includes all you can eat appetizers for $15.99 per person!

Let me begin by saying that the table booths are a little cramped for 6 adults but we managed to sit elbow to elbow without too much of an issue. Once seated, we took inventory of the small bowls of sample-sized extras that surrounded the in-table circular grill and quickly received our drinks without hardly any wait time. (THANK YOU OZZY!!) Ozzy gave great explanations of everything on the menu and was attentive to some dietary needs we had, while maintaining a sincere smile and positive attitude. This means a lot in today's food service industry.

Our only problem presented itself when the food started arriving. The grill, extra sides, drinks and our place settings left hardly any room on the table for our food! It was like playing Jenga with dishes of meat and vegetables. It was then that Ozzy informed us that we could place items on the high shelf close to the wall if we were out of room. There is a pretty good amount of room up on that shelf, but it is awkward because it sits pretty far above your head and you have to stand up to see what you have placed on it. Without that shelf, there is no way we would have been able to fit all of the plates in our eating space.

We were SO pleased with the quality of the beef, chicken, pork and seafood that came out of the kitchen. The brisket was beautifully marbled, bright red, sliced super thin and absolutely melted in my mouth. The seafood was not slimy at all, which gives me confidence in rating the freshness of their ingredients. We went through maybe 8 plates of the brisket, 4 plates of calamari, 3 orders of KFC (yummy!), 4 plates of chicken, 2 plates of pork, 3 plates of shrimp and one plate of the volcano chicken along with lots of fresh veggies, pickled veggies and kimchi. You also get unlimited rice with your meal. Our favorite appetizer was definitely the fried rice sticks but the veggie dumplings are great, too! After a couple of pitchers of Sapporo and a TON of dirty plates, we finally hit our limit.

There are 3 minor complaints that I would give these guys -
1. The lack of larger tables for larger groups (just get 2 tables if you have a group larger than 4 to avoid our issue)
2. The restaurant itself is rather dark and people on one side of the table (away from the window light) had difficulty reading their menu. This is nothing a commercial lighting redo wouldn't address, however.
3. The wait staff is paid in a tip pool and are required to split their tips. Now this may seem fair from a customer perspective, but when you work as hard as Ozzy does side-by-side next to a low-energy, non-motivated waiter (who will remain unnamed), the problem becomes clear. Please, Gen, consider giving incentive and recognition to your hard-working wait staff on a regular basis! They SUPER deserve it!

I am giving Gen a 4/5 because of the 3 issues above. The food quality is amazing and is absolutely deserving of 4 stars. I would also say that the grill doesn't really get hot enough to sear the fat on the thicker-cut pork belly the way I like it, but this may just be personal preference. Maybe cut the pork belly a little thinner to combat this. Clean plates, cups and silverware and the overall restaurant seemed well maintained. I cannot attest to the cleanliness of the restroom because I did not use it. I also did not partake in any of the drinks over at the small bar they have.

Highly recommended and I will most certainly be back, with friends!",1/4/2017 22:06,36.121441,-115.144853,855 E Twain Ave,NV,Las Vegas,89169,"Restaurants, Soul Food, Southern, Seafood, Chicken Wings",Restaurants,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Fry Dayz Fish & Wings

This restaurant was above average in terms of food and service. They take real southern comfort food and present it in an upscale fashion with flavors that truly blew my mind. I had a reservation on a weeknight and was seated within ten minutes of my arrival. Located inside the Venetian hotel, this little gem has romantic and hip vibe as far as the ambiance and the mood.  The items ordered included: 

Deviled eggs: 5/5 they were out of this world. The fresh dill really enhanced the flavors of the egg and they were topped with fresh trout roe (AKA redneck caviar). The caviar added a nice sweetness to the egg. The combination of these ingredients took this dish to another level. 

Smoked and roasted bone marrow: 5/5 WOW. I've had a lot of bone marrow in a lot of different places but what the chef creates here is beyond fantastic. One of the best bone marrow dishes I've had the pleasure to enjoy. The dish comes with country bread and onion jam. The onion jam was surprisingly sweet and not super overwhelmIng. 

Skillet cornbread: 4/5 the seasonings and flavors of this cornbread were on point. I really enjoyed the spiciness of the jalapeño and the smokiness of the cheddar and bacon baked into the nice sweet cornbread. The pieces of corn left whole inside the bread also added a great texture. 

Lewellyn's fine fried chicken: 5/5 this is not your average fried chicken. They brine the bird to lock in that amazing flavor and juiciness and create an amazing texture before frying. I was told that it takes them over 24 hours to make this fried chicken and it is well worth the calories! It is crispy on the outside, not overwhelmed with breading, and just the perfect amount of crunch. After taking the first bite and digging in my mouth was watering from these explosive flavors. The dish is served with spicy Tabasco honey. So simple yet so perfect.

Deep fried Oreos: 5/5 perfect texture and creaminess. This simple dish was so delish and perfectly satisfying to my sweet tooth. The Oreos are fried in rice crispy cereal and served with Oreo ice cream and chocolate sauce. Honestly one of the best deserts I have recently had 

House cobbler: 4/5 amazing presentation and very fresh flavors. The apple cobbler was served with a big scoop of ice cream melting on the warm crumble. The tartness of the apple went very well with the sweetness of the crumble. 

My overall meal was fantastic. I cannot explain how difficult it is to find quality food in this city and I believe that this place embodies that and more. Our waiter Justin was the one who suggested most of our choices and was super charming and timely. He made the experience at the restaurant so much better. Whilst eating the cornbread we bit into a sharp piece and were unsure whether or not it was a corn chip. Justin immediately sent us the general manager who took the pieces back to the kitchen and had them examined along with the bread. The GM, Greg, introduced himself and was extremely hospitable and considerate. He ensured us that the pieces were, in fact, corn chips and sent us desert on the house. Having worked in food safety for many years, I truly appreciated his approach and how he handled the situation. Southern hospitality at its finest. When a restaurant has great food and bad service, it will never reach its highest potential. This restaurant had both great food and great service. Kudos to the chef, the management, and the waiters for a 5/5 experience. I will be back to try the other items on the menu!",4/11/2015 17:43,36.1238755,-115.279439,"3655 S Durango Dr, Ste 9",NV,Las Vegas,89147,"Chinese, Restaurants",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Angel's Fried Rice

I strongly agree. And quite possibly top-5 in the nation. Well, I don't know about that. But if I was a doughnut-judge, I think this Las Vegas Doughnut shop should get some strong consideration. 

I was here close to 10am and half the doughnut selections were gone. But no fear; there are plenty of great tasting doughnuts for me. 

I had the Apple filled roll and a small cup of coffee for $2.25. The roll is similiar to a Cannelloni with a cinnamon-flavored apple filling. The mixture of the crunchy and flakey sugary crust combine with the apple filling makes this treat very unique.

As a fan of matcha, I got the matcha ice cream milk green tea (C1) and it was just absolutely wonderful. I could barely stop drinking it and finished really fast. I got the pearls, but it's hard to please me regarding tapioca balls so I'd pass on that next time.

Meaning, if we're having any sort of celebration for any family member that is not myself, we end up going here. I guess my parents aren't that apt to try new things, so the easy way out is mediocre Mexican at the local casino.

Look, it's not bad, but it's not great either. It is your typical Mexican fair. They have combos, burritos, dinner plates, appetizers, and seafood specials as well. Normally I go for a combo or get a burrito (usually the carne asada, because it's pretty good here, although not spectacular). 

Margaritas: Eh, they're okay and I guess the prices are okay (between $6-$9). I had a Chambord 1800 Margarita, which was actually pretty tasty. However, I also had the Cherry Lime Margarita which tasted nothing like tequila and made me think this is what hairspray must taste like if it were watered down and put in a glass. 

Lastly - their chips have never disappointed me. Always warm, and they are quick to refill your basket if they notice you're running low. Plus there is a salsa bar that provides different salsa and bean dips. Try the dark one (I think it says it is a mild), but it has a very distinctive smokey flavor that really does add some depth to the palate (I know, who says that? But it's true!).

My fat Hawaiian friend recommended this spot and after building his creditability with the Pizzeria @ The Cosmopolitan, I gave in.  Earl's is pretty easy to find and is right across from the Sugar Factory.  The sandwich shop was pretty busy, but it could of been the holiday, 4th of July.

The menu is extensive and consists of hot sandwiches, salads & wraps, desserts, breakfast items, and beverages and smoothies.  I opted for a hot sandwich, more specifically the Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  The sandwich is subtle and includes grilled chicken, roasted red & banana peppers, and their signature spicy jerk sauce.

The sandwich was mouth watering delicious.  The chicken was nicely grilled and seasoned.  The lettuce, tomato, and peppers gave it that crunch, and their jerk sauce gave it that kick without overwhelming the overall taste. The food was awesome, but I do suggest ordering a large or two sandwiches, as I was left somewhat unfilled after my regular sized sandwich.  It's no five star sandwich but it's damn close.",7/29/2011 1:25,36.1046092,-115.1760289,3770 S Las Vegas Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Desserts, Food",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,La Pasticceria

Unfortunately my brand new Acura received a nasty rock chip on the hood 3 days after driving off the lot and before bringing it in to Eco-Tint. 

Mike and his team went above and beyond to help me fix the chip with a touch up kit I got from the dealer. After the clear bra instillation, I cant tell it ever happened, and the bra is nearly invisible. 

I got the full bumper, hood, fender, headlight, side mirror, A-piilar and roof protection; oh and the door handle cups, thanks for mentioning those. 
Full window tint all around, including the sunroof, and the new Air Blue clear windshield heat/uv blocker.

It all looks fantastic; The fit and finished install is perfect, and everyone that has seen the results say my car looks awesome.

Once I saw (on Instagram, of course) that the Container Park was open, the BF and I decided to have Sunday Funday/night there. 

We came around 9pm and were greeted with the fire breathing grasshopper fronting the Container Park's entrance. 

I was immediately drawn to the lights on the trees that add to the Christmas vibe...tis the season, afterall.

Then love the look of the stores and restaurants in the containers. Container Park, itself, seems to be only a fourth filled with businesses. 

In the middle, you see a park similar to Town Square's park BUT...and it's a Big BUT, there's a fairly gigantic tree house in the middle with slides on them. Slides so big that it kinda hurt my boyfriend on the slide that makes a U-turn. ***I just wonder if security is really watching the kids and controlling who goes down and when***
In fact, the tree house was so tall that I was scared to go up more stairs because it's, like, three stories tall.

Along with the park, there's a stage next to it. Perfect for outdoor concerts! Can't wait to see how the Container Park will participate in next year's Life is Beautiful Festival.

The mix of art galleries, restaurants, bars, even hair salon adds to the eclectic mix that is the Container Park! And that was just from what was open while I was there.

1. You never know when this place is closed-  It's happened a few times that i would go during normal business hours/days and the place was closed.

Literally. You can tell the difference in air quality the second you walk in from, say, Bellagio or Aria. Non-smoking really makes a difference, the air smells so sweet. In fact, it actually smells like an Abercrombie store (maybe they infuse the air conditioners with Fierce or some other fragrance).

Service at the front desk was amazingly accommodating. We had arrived early and they were able to find us a room by 11AM, just by asking. Kevin at the front desk was great in making sure we had linens for the pull-out by giving us a call a few hours later to see if housekeeping had been by. He even put us on the 53rd floor - towering over the Bellagio with full view of the whole northern, NW and NE skylines and Bellagio's fountains.

The rooms are extremely spacious. Our ""deluxe room"" which was the lowest ranking room in the hotel sported a separated couch/sitting area, a huge bathroom, kitchenette, and two LCD TVs. It was definitely much larger than the majority of junior suites you get at most other hotels.

Food and bar options left something to be desired. Silk Road simply didn't seem appealing - but with Vegas options abound all within walking distance - who really relies solely on their Hotel's restaurant anyway.

The pool was nice and had a mixed crowd on an early September weekend. Very easy to find a nice spot that's quiet. If you're looking for a pool party though, go somewhere else. But if you're a middle-aged mom with several kids, don't worry, the pool boys here will flirt with you all you want (I saw it, firsthand, multiple times!)

For those of you who fear valet parking, it's somewhat annoying to self-park. However, you can park in the Bellagio lot - it's closer than parking at Aria, and noticeably less complicated of a walk over to Vdara than other hotels.

Overall, great find, loved it, spent some time enjoying the pool, the room.

The table started off with some of the table side guacamole. The wife makes some pretty darn good guac so it's kinda tough for me to go out and be wow'd by what we buy out. However, this was absolutely delicious. Fresh as can be and very flavorful. If you like guac, make sure you try it here!

The wife went with the street tacos. She hasn't had a ton of tacos so doesn't have much to compare it to but she fell in love with them. Said they were amazing!

I got the Mole Sampler. I gotta be honest, I didn't love the chocolate Mole. But that's not because of the way they made it, it's just because chocolate on chicken was weird for me. The green and chipotle Mole's were DELICIOUS. It came with cilantro rice and I got black beans based on server recommendation. As someone else mentioned in a review, the cilantro rice is great but it could also be called butter rice lol. 

The service was second to none. The manager made our table side guacamole and later came to check on our service and how our dinner was going.

For the entrée we had Chilean Seabass schnitzel style and a pink snapper with a soy sauce glaze.

I expected the Seabass to be lightly breaded and pan fried.  Instead it had a heavy flavorless breading and was deep-fried.  Completely tasteless to be honest did not taste anything like Seabass.

The pink snapper was also a little disappointing but much better than the Seabass.

1. Room Service: not the service/options itself, but the fact that there was no menu anywhere & I had to google it.. idk that bothers me lol.
2. Food Options: there was no breakfast buffet (big sad face for that), and the food options are on the pricier side IMO for the quality it delivers - oh I'm from Canada, but I ordered an iced coffee and it had no milk or syrup sugar in it?? I didn't know it would come black & then I couldn't really add to it cause the cup was full and sugar wouldn't dissolve  I might just be dumb but in case someone else didn't know this
3. Cleanliness: the room when I checked in was questionable to say the least.
4. Amenities: no coffee maker or fridge in the room. I read reviews saying ""that's normal,"" but I really don't think it is?? Every hotel I've ever stayed in has always offered those two things at the least

However, what it HAS done is allowed us to get standard cards with other companies.

The annual fee is annoying - but there are few no-fee cards any longer, and at the premium credit card level, you're looking at much higher annual fees (like United club cards with $450 annual fees).

Hired Rockstar to complete lawncare at three homes, one of which was desert landscaping so no grass present.  The past two weeks our backyard was untouched without explanation.  When I reached out, I was told, ""I did backyard grass last week and it was not very tall...."".  No one asked or communicated until I reached out.  We had company over for Easter and it looked unkempt, not to mention it measures 7inches tall as of today.  When I reached out to the owner after the second week of neglect, I was told we needed to pick up dog droppings.  I have three small dogs and it's expected that there's an occasional issue, however at no time was I told they simply wouldn't open the gate to mow the lawn if they saw brown.  Additionally, I scheduled this work to be done on Mondays when I'm home.  When I requested ownership make this right, after all we're paying for front and back and in each case, I've had to reach out to inquire why something wasn't done, I was told they couldn't access the backyard.  THAT'S A FIRST!  I AM HOME, our friend is home and the reason we scheduled this on Mondays is for this very reason.  The backyard is unlocked!  NO COMMUNICATION UNTIL I INQUIRED.

Our second home was even worse because our tenant kept reaching out inquiring about the additional tree trimming we paid for.  No one showed up when scheduled.  I inquired as to the date.  No one showed up again.  I was then told they were delayed and would receive a small credit.  Once the trees were trimmed, my tenant who I rarely speak with because there haven't been issues for years, reached out asking if they would finish the job.  The tenant and the vendor spoke about the trees in question, which I have in writing, yet the work wasn't completed as discussed.  The worst part was the gate to the yard was left wide open and the tenant's dog was let out.  I contacted the owner of the company and she apologized, told me the employee was fired, etc.  The next week, the backyard grass wasn't cut and again, I was told that the tenant needed to pick up the dog droppings.  Ironically, the tenant was the one asking me for the date and approximate time of service when we contracted with this vendor.  She wanted to make sure everything was picked up.  When I told the owner we were unhappy, the excuse was that it would take a month to pick up all the dog droppings.  I was told the back was trimmed and blown out yet the tenant was home, no car in the driveway like it typically is and she stated the landscaper was gone within five minutes, never went in the backyard.

The third house...gate left open, weeds everywhere even though it's rock landscaping.  The tenant of seven+ years contacted me furious that the gate was left open and his dogs could've run away.  He sent me photos.  I asked the owner to make things right and I was told they only allocate one hour to each home, she and a helper have both pulled weeds and the gate was not left open.  In fact, I was told this was becoming ridiculous.  THIS TENANT HASN'T SAID A WORD IN YEARS yet we change landscapers and he's upset.

At no time did the vendor recommend services.  At no time did they say they couldn't get into the yard (uh, it's unlocked!), until I said she needed to make things right because they didn't perform the work. I never asked for a full refund.  Some work was done and payment was made. Three out of three homes had issues on multiple occasions and each was different yet one thing remains...the chances of three people who have no incentive to lie, don't have the same complaints and it certainly doesn't take email upon email to understand why a vendor wouldn't just do the job they stated they would do.

7.31.18 Ownership felt the need to discredit my review by placing blame on me when they were SUPPOSED to be the professionals.  It's been difficult finding a contractor who shows up and does the basic work.  Our expectations are so low that a heartbeat would suffice.  Unfortunately, we've lost income from our tenants who are upset (2 of them) by the crappy work.  Glad this is in the past and all we asked for was a small credit for work that wasn't completed.

mRv8ASAItyYcEMYNVWGTLQ,7lrp7Cu7pjMmzl3agGXDXg,NY80DkkCfEl198JmwtO4pA,3,0,0,0,"This is based on staying in the updated Valley tower twice over a several week period.  I've stayed exclusively at MGM casinos (Luxor, Mirage) the last several years, and this is my first visits to a Caesar's property.

Check in: Both times I stayed here I was the guest of a friend with high level of Total Rewards. First visit we showed up (on a Thursday) at 5pm. She told us it would be awhile, and we would get a call when the room is ready. Two hours later we went back, the lady was gone with no call. We got checked right in by somebody else. What a burn. 

On this visit my friend had pre-registered. It was 430PM and when she used the check in machine it said we would get an email when room was ready. What crap. we went to the front desk and got checked right in. This is all a pain. Plus they have 4PM check in, the MGM hotels are 3PM. 

I never got told my room wasn't ready in a dozen MGM hotels stays. But twice in a row at Caesars hotels. 

Casino: A lot of my favored slots are here. I have to say also that the drinks are flowing and the servers are on the ball! Couple dry spots sort of ignored, but it happens (but should not be hard to get a drink at the popular Game of Thrones slots). But there are also spots very good for a fast drink serve.  There are also some dead ends along the walkthrough areas that had me scratching my head. Maze like spots.

Room: The Valley rooms are weird. They seem to have been updated by a design school grad with something to prove.

First, it looks like what they thought the future would look like in 70's sci fi. The bathroom door is sliding heavy Plexiglas of some kind. When open it covers the closet and safe. I almost bashed my friends head at least twice when I was coming out and she was accessing the safe. We had to make mental notes to shout out when leaving toilet. C'mon.  There for sure are going to be lawsuits. I predict these doors will be gone in three years. Oh, also, no lock on this door. Great. 

The shower has a weird half door set up. Very lame. And though wide, the shower head is weak. not a brisk shower that will wake you up. 

The sink has a faucet that is just a horrible design. If it is on only a little, it starts flooding the sink area and floor. Wow.  I will say though, the rooms were clean.  

Food area: I will say I hated what passes for food options. They seem to only have sit down, expensive meal areas. Great, I can pay 14 bucks for chicken strips and stare at dumb Toby Keith cutouts. I was going to, but told me I had to finish my drink. I said screw it and had some crackers and tuna in the room.

This has the feel of a lower casino in a lot of ways. That they offer no economical food court is just crap. I stay at Luxor a lot, a much higher end place, and you have like a dozen to go places with casual options. And I eat a lot at California Pizza Kitchen at Mirage, and they never told me to finish my beer. I take it right to the table.

If you live in a big city center and are used to going downstairs walking half a block to bars, convenience stores and the like you might not like this hotel. Its the exact opposite. Its like living in the isolated hills and needing a car to get to everything outside of this resort. 

That being said once you get here you don't ever have to leave. I'm sure the gift shop could fill in as a convenience store and restaurants, bars, and everything else is here.

The huge buffet, the incredible pool - complete with sandy beach, the rooftop club way up high with Strip views... its all here. 

Rooms are also a big, big plus. They are large. They are considered suites but according to Webster's dictionary they don't really fit the textbook definition of a  suite. They are just one big room instead of two rooms as in a proper suite. I've had proper suites - the great part is if your with a few friends the one grumpus can go to sleep early, shut the bedroom door and the rest can keep the lights on in the living room. Can't do that here in the standard suits.

I like the value aspect of this property. But when your on the other side of the highway it gets you better views but you also feel like your missing out.

As usual it was a good time and nice room, view was ok.  I like the end of the hall rooms; they call them parlor rooms.  They are a little larger than the regular rooms and tend to have nice views.  The only downside to this trip was when I went to the Diamond Check in to ask about a late checkout, the CSR said the best she could do was 12.  I then sent a text to IVY, the automated assistant, and asked for a late checkout.  Within 30 seconds I was told that I can checkout at 2pm.  I wish I took down her name, because to me, that was substandard service and really not trying.  Yes, I am a lowly Diamond player, but IVY told me I was a Valued Diamond member lol...

Le Reve is not a part of Cirque du Soleil, although it was created by the director of other Cirque shows. It's a water acrobatic show with a circular stage, so every seat is a good seat. We sat a few rows above the splash zone (the first two rows) along the aisle, and we had a great view. I still got splashed a little but not too bad. 

The acrobatics were truly amazing, as with any Cirque show. But you appreciate it more because of the water element, knowing that the performers are constantly wet from diving in and out of the water. The roof opens up, where some performers are lowered down to do stunts. In addition to the acrobatics, there is dancing and a little bit of comedy. The show was continuous, so no boring breaks in-between acts.

A few complaints, though ... at times, there is so much stuff going on, that you're constantly looking around the entire stage, so you don't miss something. But you end up missing something anyway. Secondly, there really is no storyline. My boyfriend disagrees, but although I understood the beginning and the end, nothing in the middle made any sense. Like what was the devil doing? And who was that guy with the cane? Maybe I just didn't get it, but it didn't seem clear to me, and I usually need a storyline to keep me interested!

We got a discount on our tickets, and I would recommend looking for one. I found several discounts online, and we just used the best one. We considered getting the VIP package, but I wasn't convinced that it was worth the $195/person cost. 

Overall, it was a good show, and I enjoyed it much more than Mystere, the last Cirque show I saw. I almost opted to get tickets for Zumanity or Criss Angel instead because of cheaper ticket prices. But after reading the reviews on Yelp, I think I would have regretted it, and I'm happy that we went with Le Reve!",10/27/2010 19:57,36.16608231,-115.1532251,Clark County Amphitheater,NV,Las Vegas,89155,"Restaurants, Vegetarian, Vegan, Festivals, Arts & Entertainment",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,Entertainment,Restaurants_FoodEntertainment,Vegas Veg Fest

I'm giving it 2 stars only because my 18 hour braised short ribs were pretty decent ... It would have been better had it not been COLD. When they said ""18-hour braised"" I didn't think they meant it would feel like 18 hours had passed before you got your food. 
My entire party's food was cold. We had ordered some drinks and wine, and had to wait at least half an hour for us to get our drinks. Some of them got the wrong drink order and some drinks given to the wrong people. I supposed when it takes you that long to get a drink, you tend to forget whose drink belongs to whom -__-  still, I'm pretty sure it doesn't take that long to get wine.

I first want to say what a beatiful library.  My daughter attended a weekly program on Gold for the children.  The instructor made learning about gold really fun.  The teacher even had then pan for gold as well.  My daughter and her friends had a great time and I personally as a Mom was very impressed with the classes offered for children in the local libraries.  The Children's book  area was very clean and had a great selection of books to choose. The librarian was approachable for the kids and really got them exciting about reading and being apart of their summer reading program.  What I didn't like - lack of seating while our children were in the class.  We walked around and around trying to find an area to sit when we stumbled to this great little lounge area with cool tall table and chairs.  We sat here and talked when we were approached by a very rude employee telling us we could not be in there since we were not a teenager.  She was young herself and maybe she will learn how to handle things but she was just plain rude.  She could have explained to us why we really coudn't be in there.  We went to the librarian in the children's area and she explained it is that if the teenagers saw adults in there they wouldn't go in there.  Please add more seating around the library.

Other Salons: I had my top and bottom lashes done twice in the past and once woke up with lashes all over my cheeks. They said bottom lashes will only last a few days (paid $25)- it lasted 3 days. I've left these salons with my eyes burning, because for the ENTIRE procedure, the glue SEEPED into my eyes. Each time I was told it's normal...Can you imagine the horror?

Surely, they use a much better solution for the glue. Tge regular glue stung my eyes a bit (not as bad as the other places), but Kaylie immediately accommodated me and switched to the sensitive. There was no glue that ever went into my eyes

Vegas was packed...with the strip looking like the perfect-feeding/multiplication-ground for a zombiepocalyse that emergency measures were immediately taken to get both the lady and I out...QUICK...before disaster strikes. So zipping away from the strip, she immediately asked where we were headed. GOOD OLD VEGAS was my immediate reply. Pulling her trusty iPhone out, she started looking at destinations to check out. Five minutes later, we were keen on Binion's Ranch Steakhouse as it promised ""great service with a great view over good food"".

The parking lot was unsurprisingly empty and the old-Vegas almost-prehistoric feel permeated the air. Fine...fine...it wasn't exactly PREHISTORIC but definitely a drop (not a leap) back in time. It was a feeling similar to staring at a much-beloved-386 computer (if you're even old enough to know this) after using and getting accustomed to a spiffy-oh-so-hot-and-bank-breaking Alienware or MacBook Pro for several years. Yet, seeing a 386 computer once again doesn't mean I would back away. Rather, just like I used to grab my little box of 5"" floppy disks in anticipation to stuff it into the floppy drives to begin playing DotT (Day of the Tentacle - and if you remember and have played this game...you immediately get an additional Yelp fan who will read and UFC your freaking reviews), I held the lady's hand and eagerly made our way through stale-tobacco-scented corridors to the elevator that would port us up and back in time.

We reached and entered the elevator without seeing a single soul. As the ascent began, the zombiepocalypse image returned. Crap, did they attack old Vegas first and we just stupidly volunteered to become fresh ingredients in their gruesome-human-buffet? GREAT...@#*&^$*&@^#!!!!!! 

Elevator door opens and we walk right out to see...a cool-demeanor-well-dressed-gentleman with a smile on his face that immediately implied no such harm has descended upon this area - yet. Of course, that reassuring welcome and asking if we had reservations and such immediately removed all the zombie crap in my mind and refocused my attention to this...nostalgic feeling. Where are we? I almost thought I had grey hair with a backed so hunched that complimented a croaking voice. (Ok, just kidding, I should describe something like Elvis instead...).

Our table overlooked the city in the evening lights. Although, I can't say it was mesmerizing or romantic in the least, we did somewhat enjoy the difference and spent some time pointing and figuring out the area while discussing what it probably was like 30 years ago.

Service was spectacular...and very accommodating. My lady has certain refined preferences with her vegetables and meat (unlike the recycling/food-processing plant that I am that eats everything up and then complains after as necessary) and our server made sure every single part of it was met.

The food wasn't as spectacular as their service and fell in the ""decent"" category. Both the New York and Rib-eye steaks came out done exactly the way we wanted them cooked...the former being medium well and the latter completely alive for the blood craving diner. Steaks were under-salted but that is not an issue in my books as a little toying with the salt dispenser on the table immediately got it exactly to the requirements of our differing palettes. 

The overall experience was decent and I would recommend a visit if you (a) want to get away from the overwhelming crowds on the strip; (b) crave a decent steak; (c) want to view old Vegas from atop a building without getting a room; or (d) want to port back to a different era.",11/30/2012 4:05,36.038422,-115.1934781,3725 Blue Diamond Rd,NV,Las Vegas,89139,"Pizza, Nightlife, Chicken Wings, Restaurants, Sports Bars, Bars",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Brando's Sportsbar

It even has some gambling tables set up for those that can't get enough! 

We got there early because the line gets INSANE. So unless you're on the guest list, which btw, they didn't have on the Saturday night we were there, make it a point to be timely. Don't worry about being the first ones there; the club fills up very quickly. 

If you're willing to spend a shit load of money, they have ample bottle service areas. There's bed after bed, lounge after lounge, table after table and all in prime locations. My friends and I opted the cheaper route: standing.

The only complaint I have is that the dance floor got so packed that you literally couldn't breathe. In my opinion, it's too small for how large a venue it is. It was just impossible to enjoy myself when I was repeatedly slammed in to, stepped and spilled on, even wasted it was unbearable.

I also had the papaya salad and the pork with coconut rice. Thankfully, the papaya salad helped bring down the saltiness from the wings. Pork was dry. This place was a huge disappointment considering I spent over $30 on myself for it.

The service was impeccable beginning at the entrance of the restaurant. When I arrived the hostess handed me a handwritten birthday card, and throughout the entire dinner all the staff went out of their way to wish me a happy birthday.

The food was so delicious. Our party ordered nearly everything on the menu, including several bottles of chianti. One of the specials for the night was a black truffle pasta which was heavy but delicious. I had little bites of everything. The entree item I ordered was the pennette.

Luckily, my party was blessed with my presence because I ate at Kona Grill several times before since I used to have a cousin that worked at Kona Grill. I have eaten most of the items from the menu so I was their food expert there. I did recommend the calamari, lettuce wraps, miso sake sea bass, basil pesto linguini, and macadamia nut chicken. 

The future hubby and I ordered the calamari and miso sake sea bass, which used to be my favorite. When we got our order, I was highly disappointed. It wasn't what I remember ever having. The calamari did not taste fresh, the miso-sake sea bass was tough, and the rice tasted old/stale.

I guess the one downside of sitting on the terrace was being in the quiet company of so many buttoned-up types.  Our fellow diners were stuffy grumps, sitting silently across from each other and scowling instead of engaging in conversation.  It was like being in a caricature of what rich people are like.

You have never had coffee until you've had a cup from Sunrise. Even though I've only had the nutella espresso, I can almost guarantee everything else is just as good. First off, this isn't your watered down weak coffee, it is strong and concentrated coffee which is how it is supposed to be. The nutella topped off the espresso just right. I love how they offer different flavors and also how you can choose your own milk. The selection is endless!

Yes this is the same Boiling Crab as you can find in San Jose and Southern California. The one difference for the one here in Vegas is that there really is no wait (at least for the couple of times that I have been there). The Boiling Crab is a lot bigger than the ones in Southern California and now have a huge wall of tvs that will be great to watch any sporting event, especially once football season starts. 

You must get the whole shabang sauce (basically extra butter, garlic and spices) to marinate your selection of seafood. You can select how spicy you like, I usually get medium so I can still taste the seafood flavor of the shrimp and king crab legs. I am not a huge fan of crawfish so I usually don't order that. Other things that are must orders include corn and sausage (added to your shrimp), a side of rice to eat with the sauce, some fresh oysters to start, and maybe a fried fish basket with cajun fries.

Also my arms and shoulders were massage while the mask is on.  

After the facial, my experience didn't end there.  She continue to put on makeup that is good for my skin, Jane Iredale products.  During the facial, I had told her how I was using MAC products on my skin, and learned that those products are not good for my skin due to the chemicals and fragrance that are heavily infused in them.

When she proceed to hand me the mirror and I looked at my face...WOW, this makeup is wonderful.  My skin look so nice and the color blended so well!  I fell in love with this line of makeup.

I also purchased dermologica daily microexfoliant that is made using rice.

I thought, if this location did not brown the skin properly (as was the case in the past), it be no big deal, because I would be removing the skin from the chicken anyway for the dog. When I got the chicken home, it was cooked perfectly, and the skinned browned properly. So i ate some of it, and it was great.

One disappointment was finding this place. It's literally in the corner of the two buildings in the lot. There's a sign on a wall (that needs a little more to make it stand out) We obviously missed it and ended up driving into the next lot. We then saw the main sign when we were on the street. Sooo for future reference: it's between a Shabu-Shabu restaurant and Brighton Family Medicine. 

We walked in and it was surprisingly small and packed in there. We came at 9am, thinking it was going to be a bit more empty... Nope! People like eating early lol. Despite how busy it was, we were seated immediately. I wasn't too thrilled with our server, I don't even think he introduced himself. But he did check on us a couple times and made sure we had what we needed before disappearing.

It was packed in there and just as loud. I could barely hear myself or my sister talk. That's where the fifth star went -- disappeared with my unheard words. 

The food is where the four stars came from, though! There was a lot to choose from, everything sounded delicious! I ended up with the country Benedict. Pretty much country friend steak just on a biscuit with a side of house potatoes. The house potatoes reminded me of Thanksgiving stuffing because of how it looks but it tastes better lol.

They tend to butcher it pretty badly, but even my boyfriend who is Taiwanese said their Chinese food was pretty good - and he's a tough critic when it comes to that.

Probably my favorite thing about this buffet is that they serve gelato at the dessert section! I LOVE GELATO! They always have different flavors, too, so it's never boring.

The difference is that these are mixed with quality ingredients, and are specialty drinks. If you want just a Bud Light, or a rum & Coke, you should go somewhere else. 

The only issue I have, is that once the DJ is there, the music is a bit too loud. Since this is a lounge, and not a nightclub, most people are there to hang out and have a conversation. With the music being so loud, having a conversation is a little challenging. Just a few clicks lower on the volume dial would make a big difference.

The burrata was creamy and delicious on the persimmon and pear slices. I would definitely order this again.

Sinatra music pumps softly through the speakers, a good mix of his tunes and adds to the atmosphere. The restaurant has a beautiful outdoor area with a fireplace and a garden.

This was a birthday dinner for me and they had little touches waiting for me such a hand-written birthday card, free birthday cookies on a plate that said ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate.

Don't worry, the waiters won't come out wearing sombreros singing happy birthday or anything.

The restauraunt offered a 3 course prix fixe menu from 5:30-6:30 that we took advantage of, the value was fantastic compared to the standard menu prices ($40-50 entrees are the norm). Chef Theo Schoenegger makes amazingly delicious dishes. I don't know where the kitchen finds their mushrooms, but the mushroom risotto was spectacular, as was the chicken marsala.

I didn't request any beef fat on it, so it couldn't be that. The beef balls didn't help either. I like to call it the bacon wrapped in bacon effect. Having a strong beefy broth and beef balls doesn't add anything to the dish, you're just eating beef.

At least, the ingredients are good. Just execution didn't work on the Pho. The pho could have been served much hotter, but at least it wasn't lukewarm.

The service is good although the servers don't have to do much other than bring you drinks. They don't even have to clear your plates until you're done because they count them at the end so they know how much to charge you. The sushi was just okay. It didn't stand out in my mind and there isn't even a roll that I could recommend because it was just average. Surprisingly my favorite items were the little tacos they had. We ordered those for delivery on the little trolley thing which was pretty cool. This place is more for the experience rather than the food.

I'm from Toronto, so we have quite a few of these places scattered throughout the city.  HOWEVER, I must add that I don't think the Toronto places offer homemade ice cream or cakes that look relatively homemade.  We do have a fair share of tea places, so after following the hype, I thought this place was just OK.

Perhaps my impression would've been better if I had tea/piece of cake, but I was absolutely stuffed, so decided on homemade ice cream instead.  It was very good, nice texture, but they had run out of 1 out of the 2 toppings I selected.

Menu is somewhat limited and I've posted it so you can see their offerings.  It's basically an Asian tea place - NOT boba/bubble tea, that offers both hot/iced teas (~$5ea), with a handful of desserts including Asian inspired cakes, HK waffles, toast with some accoutrements, etc. but furnished in a way to look as if it's outdoors.

A great addition would be a green tea/sesame soft serve machine.  I think that would be a nice addition to the menu!

Service was just ok too.  Nothing memorable.",5/15/2017 22:11,36.1139419,-115.3084925,4165 S Grand Canyon Dr,NV,Las Vegas,89147,"Bagels, Food",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Bruegger's

9/7/17. 
RUN FROM THESE PEOPLE. 
I have motorcycle towing service through Kawasaki. My motorcycle wouldn't start. I called Kawasaki on 9/7/17 and they sent out PHENOMENTAL TOWING SERVICE (who they contract with). It took over 2 hours to get where I was. I called their office (dispatch hardly speaks English) but, they said was already on way. 
Driver showed up and, in broken English, he told me he ""didn't know the first thing about motorcycles."" What??? He's getting paid to tow a motorcycle and doesn't know the first thing about motorcycles?  He told me I needed to help him load it on his tow truck (this gigantic flatbed truck that could fit another truck on). 
I told him I had had triple by-pass surgery and was not gonna help him load a big, heavy-duty motorcycle on his truck in 110 degree heat in Las Vegas; that's his job; that's what he's getting paid for. If needed help, should bring help; he knew FULL WELL where he was going and what the job entailed before ever came out to me.  Do not depend on the customer with heart disease to help him. 
He went back to his truck and talked to dispatch again. He came back and asked me if there was anyone else in house who could help him. There wasn't'. He got back into his truck and left. No explanation; no help; no nothing.  What if I was standing in the hot sun (which fortunately I wasn't) on a major expressway in Vegas (where I am) in 110 degree heat without any water? You want a jerk company like this to show up to help you???
I called Kawasaki back and within 1 hour they sent me Scott Harris from CUSTOM CYCLE RESCUE in Vegas. This guy truly is PHENONMENIAL!!!!! Within 1 minute, Scott had cycle loaded and on his way. He had all special equipment and straps and truck to properly haul a motorcycle; whereas, Phenomenal Towing LLC had none of that and didn't even know how to get it on their truck without help, much less properly strap it down.

I am surprised at how low the ratings average rating of this establishment is.  The service is good and the aesthetics are nice.

I suspect the primary reasons for client disappointment are:
1.  Pricing is expensive for the what you get.
2.  The food is not as fancy or quality as the more expensive restaurants in the Casino.
3.  Being in a 5 star resort of the Aria elevates client expectations possible too much.

Pretty legit place for fingers and fries. There used to be a Chicken Bonz over on Sunset in Green Valley, but it has since become Chicken Shack, and Chicken Bonz was reborn right of the 215 on Decatur.

This place serves up reallllllly bomb chicken fingers, with a bunch of sauces that will satisfy even the pickiest of chicken connoisseurs. They also have regular bone in wings, and burgers (I don't know why I guess some people don't want chicken?).

Its a pretty interesting place, there are a couple of arcade machines set-up which definitely earns the place points because it takes a while to get the food sometimes. It seems to be a mom n pop kind of place so they do go the extra mile to make sure you are happy. Unlike Chicken Shack, there isn't a extra charge for a side of ranch which for me is a huge pet peeve.

I have never been to this location before but think of Outback as decent steak chain restaurant at affordable price. On this night decided wanted to mix it up also instead of going for steak had the Grill Mahi with vegetables.I had my doubts cause really go steakhouse eat steak. I was pleasantly surprise with the whole dish. The Mahi was grilled perfect nice char grill marks, cooked through, moist, and even without sauce had great taste. The vegetables was all cooked nice al dente from the zucchini, carrots, and broccoli. 

We ordered couple appetizers to share the calamari and the spinach artichoke dish. The calamari dish would say was ok. I felt like the calamari was little too crispy or overdone. The spinach artichoke dip would say was fabulous. The chips was nice light, crispy, and add nice scoop of spinach dip was delicious. The bread that comes with the meal. One thing always look forward to whenever come to Outback. Love it!!! I also ordered side caesar salad. I felt was ok nothing really special about it and felt like the salad could have used more dressing. But then again I like my salad with nice amount.

The service was great! She was very attentive the whole night on our drinks, friendly, and could not ask for better service. 

The decor thought was pretty modern for long standing chain restaurant. Or maybe they just changed the whole philosophy or what not.

It was a real highlight of my move to Vegas. I had talked with the Pizza Rock Twitter for months leading up to me coming out here and was told I""would be taken care of"" when I first ordered here. I had no idea what that meant but I thought it was really cool they were taking care of their loyal fans or something. 

So I didn't feel like going and getting food and having to take it back on the bus or walking. Luckily I found a bike service that would actually deliver to my apartment. How cool was that? So I went and finally got a hold of Pizza Rock and talked to the guys and just said ""oh by the way the twitter said I would get taken care of my first visit, whatever that meant"". Then it was like I was trying this huge scam, Tommy the manager was trying to help, but he tells me to go back to Twitter and talk to them. Then Twitter backtracks and says they never said anything and starts ignoring me. At that point I'm beyond done.  I decide forget about it. 

I call back to try to explain to the restaurant maybe how to fix this and get put on with GM Ricky who immediately takes an antagonistic, smug, and condescending attitude with me. Saying how he is going to say ""take care of"" means we'll take care of you and I'm basically stupid for thinking anything more and basically just being an all around dick. Pretty much saying I was trying to scam them or play entitlement for some free food. No worries, I told him to go F himself. It's a shame but if that's the kind of people Pizza Rock wants to hire, they get what they deserve. 

As I type this, I am eating 40 dollars worth of Happy's Pizza. May not be top quality, but gave me 100% less headaches. Should have been Pizza Rock's money but can't support a place that has people treating loyal fans and first time customers the way GM Ricky was.

We went there after a little past 8pm on a Friday night, we were prepared to wait forever but surprisingly there wasn't any line for dine in, but the drive thru was very busy. 

For a fast food chain, they have a very fresh quality food. I ordered the Spicy Deluxe and it was really good. The waffle fries was a little undercook for me so next time I'll order them well done/extra crispy. The service was very fast and the staff are super friendly. The fine in area is also clean. Just FYI, the drinks are behind the counters next to the register, but you do get refills for as many as you want.  And the staff are very good with checking on you if you need any refills or extra sauce. My favorite dipping sauce is their Garlic Ranch.

Now, to be fair you can't compare this rail to anything in a regular city - if you do then sure it's not quite a 5. But for me, the monorail was a savior on a Sat night when I wanted to get from LVH to the strip.

Great things about the monorail:

-Day pass is only $12 (c'mon that's not expensive considering you know you'll drop that in a slot machine in no time)
-It's a monorail so you'll just go up and down the line (there is north and southbound lanes so not a true monorail), but no need to worry about getting lost.
-A good amount of stops should get you pretty to close to most hotels on the strip.
-AC, comfy seats, not crowded, safe and clean
-runs until 3am on weekends!
-no need to drive, take a cab, or bus so you won't sit in traffic.

Now that I know about the monorail, it will be my go to transportation when I'm near the convention center, and even when I want to go up and down the strip. 

Bad things about monorail:
-Can be hard to find (go online and get a map of locations to know what hotel and what area the stations are located)
-The monorail is at the back of most hotels so you'll be doing some walking to get to the front of the strip, but not too bad.

The menu selection is above & beyond anything I would have ever expected to come out of a mall. 

The Tomato Basil Soup with the Parmesan Crostini is so delicious. Definitely the best Tomato Basil I've ever had! 

Mixed Berry Salad with Chicken is my favorite salad. It has strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, candied walnuts, blue cheese & mixed greens tossed in a raspberry vinaigrette with chilled chicken. So good. I'm normally not too huge on blue cheese in my salads, because its such a dominant flavor- but with the berries, it neutralizes the sweetness. 

OKAY, & the best part of all...they have Creme Brulee! Very, very good Creme Brulee. Definitely the cherry on top of a great meal! 

Now that I have my own mouth watering, I will stop talking about food & let you know that the service is wonderful! Its kind of self service in the sense that you pay for your food, get your drink & pick a seat. From there- a server will bring your food out to you & refill your drink.

Six appetizers are available to choose from (two with supplemental pricing), six entrees (two with supplemental pricing), and three dessert options. The tempting pricing supplements, which range from $10-15 extra, can quickly drive the prix-fixe up, but there are attractive options when sticking to the $22 menu as well.

Bread is served warm, crusty on the outside and very soft on the inside. Fruity olive oil is served instead of butter, something I actually prefer almost every time.

Fried Calamari fresh calamari, lightly fried with lemon - This starter isn't part of the fixed menus, but was one of the house specialties so we gave it a try. The batter was light and crispy, delicate with tender squid. With a light squeeze of lemon, these were simple but delicious bites. However at $24 a plate, there isn't a ton of value here since you could get another 3-course for less.

Fresh Diver Scallop Skewer with green bell pepper, sweet onion & couscous - My mother had these skewered scallops; cooked well, these were tender and moist. Some sweetness from bell peppers and onion were a welcome accompaniment.

Grilled Octopus sashimi quality Mediterranean octopus, charcoal-broiled - A $10 supplement, this was one of the better dishes of the lunch. Extremely tender, the octopus was contrasted with a bright onion flavor and fresh parsley. Loved the texture.

Fresh Maryland Lump Crab Cake with marinated gigantes beans & mustard emulsion - Another $10 supplement from the appetizer options, I liked the delicate crust of the crab cake but overall flavors were fairly muted. Not bad, but not the most interesting.

We tried four of the entree options.

Lavraki grilled Mediterranean bass - This was a hit; the dense flesh of the bass was very moist and the skin was oh-so-crispy. A touch of fruity olive oil and salty capers were a nice addition to the fish, which didn't need much more.

Organic Chicken Breast Skewer grilled mushrooms & onions, served over pita - My cousin got this dish; the lone piece of chicken that I tried was pretty dry.

Colorado USDA Prime Lamb Chops french fries & broccoli - My grandmother opted for the lamb chops ($10 supplement), cooked a nice medium rare. Tender and juicy, this was a good option for someone wanting to avoid the seafood route.

Nova Scotia Deep Sea Lobster Pasta light tomato sauce - I went for this dish. Although the $15 pricing supplement was relatively steep, there seemed to be a lot of value in this dish. A whole small lobster was carefully broken apart, leaving the meat bathed within linguini and a light tomato cream sauce. The lobster was just a touch more cooked than what I would've liked, but was sweet and tasty nonetheless. The pasta had a nice richness without being too heavy.

For dessert, we tried two of the three options.

Fresh Fruits of the Season - Pretty much as advertised.

Walnut Cake with Kaimaki ice cream - The cake was sweet, slightly earthy, and pretty moist. The ice cream was refreshing; interestingly, it's made from the resin of mastic trees, native to Greece.

We enjoyed our meal here and I wouldn't mind returning for lunch. I wouldn't say it was good enough to inspire a visit for a $100+ dinner, though. The scallops and Lavraki fish would make an excellent $22 lunch meal; in terms of the supplements, I'd splurge on the octopus and lobster pasta again. Heck, many Vegas buffets are more than $22 for lunch; you don't get the same variety but the quality at Milos is clearly several notches above. Definitely recommended for a lunch visit, but I'll have to read more positive reviews to visit for dinner.",7/26/2013 6:26,36.12689968,-115.2413651,6850 Spring Mountain Rd,NV,Las Vegas,89146,"Food Court, Restaurants",Restaurants,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Korea Town Plaza Food Court

First we are given a really lousy table in the corner as if my husband has been very bad that he deserve to be punished in the corner(considering this is his special day-b-day). Waiters are clueless, they are just standing in the middle but most of the time really doing nothing that in few ocassions I have to pour my own wine in my glass. The head waiter is the only one who seems to be working and who do know what to do here.
            We are given a small apetizer courtesy of the chef bec of my husbands b-day which is a good touch, I love this little appetizer (not in the menu, wish it was there because that would be the only highlight of the evening) a concoction of smoke chicken with couscous with a little spices, the taste is all balance and in harmony.
           The fried green tomatoes appetizer is bland, whatever coating and sauce they put in there didnt help at all.  The spinach and raddichio salad is soaked on its own dressing which you cannot even tell which dressing it is, salads when presented are supposed to be crisp, so make sure you only put the dressing when it is ready to be eaten, very disappointing since the head weater gladly recommended this dish.
          My husband ordered Bone in Ribeye Steak, huge, cooked perfect but no taste or seasoning at all, it would need some sort of sauce to make it appetizing.  Filet mignon is OK, just like any other filet mignon, nothing great about it.
         Luckily there's one dish that is worth mentioning, the potato gratin dauphineous, excellent, potato perfectly cooked, not much cream, hint of garlic and toasty top, excellent!

She's a diamond in the rough.

9 21 year old girls on New Years, and we wanted a place that wasn't too expensive, but had an open bar.  Unfortunately, that was I-Bar. The reviews weren't bad and the description and video tour made it out to be an actual club in the Rio. We were with our best friends, in Vegas, at a club.  How bad could it be?  So, $140 later, we had tickets for New Years. 

Then we got there... and let me tell you...it was BAD. The 'club' is merely a raised platform bar in the middle of the casino.  It smelled like cigarettes and we were the youngest people there by 30 years.  There was no room to stand and we weren't allowed to sit down because we hadn't purchased a 'table' (why anyone would purchase a table there is beyond me). Then we found out other people had walked in for free. Cool.  

The fact that they make this place out to be something is not, and charged us anything to get in, is what the real problem is.  Don't be fooled people...its a bar smack in the middle of a casino.  It ruined my New Years and i hope you never have to experience what I did at I-Bar.

I do, however, suggest checking it out if you want a good laugh.  Just picture 9 hot 21 years old girls, decked out for New Years, in the bar and you'll guaranteed get a good chuckle.",1/2/2008 22:10,36.2911461,-115.1817169,"Aliante Station Hotel & Casino, 7306 Aliante Pkwy",NV,North Las Vegas,89084,"Restaurants, Italian",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Pasta Cucina

The staff really tried hard to make up for the problems I experienced, but there's only so many times and so much they can do before you question things. I still greatly enjoyed my meal but it was filled with errors all night long. 

We came at 10pm on a reservation but weren't seated until 10:45pm. Considering we had a reservation, that's fairly ridiculous. I do understand they can't seat us until a table is open, but don't offer me the reservation option in the first place then. It's an easy thing to honor.  We were offered a free drink ticket to compensate us for the wait, however, which was a nice touch. 

The food and drinks were very good during the meal. To drink we had the woodsman (bourbon based, little too sweet), the electric avenue (strong, old fashioned type, very good), and the bubbles and berries (fruity, boozy, great). To eat we had the tomato tartare, sliders, fish tacos, and ratatouille. Here's where the biggest issue came - the pace of the meal. The only explanation I can think of is the kitchen forgot about us. The tartare came out fast enough. It was exceptional; it was one of the better dishes I've had in Vegas actually. It had a sundried tomato taste with a small runny egg on top. Our next dish, the fish taco, came out literally an hour later. The fries on top were exceptional while the actual taco was just fine. The sliders were quite nice and actually an ok deal at $8 each. The ratatouille came last, a little out of order if you ask me, but was very good. I wish it came out wth the sliders to make that a full meal but whatever.  The presentation of all the dishes was a nice touch. 

Because we waited so long for our food we were again offered free drinks and dessert. The staff was really trying to make it up to us but at that point it was getting kind of funny that our meal just kept getting wrecked and fixed nonstop. So in the end we tried the donuts and root beer float. I would say the donuts in chocolate sauce were great but the float and the rest of the sauces were a pass. Very good coffee here as well. 

So after a good meal and all the free drinks and dessert, the meal only cost $75. That's a ridiculous steal even after a 3 hour atypical food excursion. I would come back because I really think they were having an off night and they deserve another chance. They do try to make it up to you if they mess up so I appreciate that, but my advice is, as a customer, give yourself time, don't make plans right after the dinner, and expect a long meal.",5/21/2017 16:11,36.1608501,-115.3334837,"10870 W Charleston Blvd, Ste. 180",NV,Las Vegas,89135,"Delis, Restaurants, Fast Food, Sandwiches",Restaurants,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Jimmy John's

I hate bugs and scorpions scare the bejesus out of me! Not to mention my elderly mom lives with me now and the stings can really be brutal to young kids and seniors.

I was referred to a not to be named pest control company to help me and I kid you not, this guy was in and out in less than 10 minutes. I asked how effective his treatment was and he said very and said I would even ask myself, ""What did this guy do? There's dead scorpions everywhere!"" Well, later that night I was in my backyard and he was half right...there was a live scorpion...unfazed by their treatment.

Long story short, the next day a salesman, Jeff, knocked on my door and sold me on Preventive telling me how extensive the service was. I signed up and Cameron showed up in two days. The other company came with a can and small sprayer. Cameron with Preventive showed up with a truck that had a huge tank attached to it and a power washer and soaked my entire front and backyard with 10 gallons of scorpion death! Then he sprayed the inside of the house with a similar canister the other company used for the outside, but with a higher caliber poison. Later that night I saw two cockroaches outside freaking out and, knock on wood, no scorpions. They use a thorough treatment the first time out that takes over an hour to complete (far cry from the other company's 8 minutes), come back in two weeks for the standard treatment that takes 30 minutes to apply and then come out every other month. That's how strong their poison is. One treatment lasts two months.

It's only been a couple of days but I am very impressed. I hope this solves my scorpion problem and judging by what they did the first time out, this should do the trick. I'm happy so far. Both Jeff my salesman and Cameron my temp exterminator are class acts.

With that being said my fiancee and my experience with the V Theater which is where the Las Vegas comedy club is located was terrible. My fiancee and I attempted to go see a comedy show at the V theater. I had purchased a groupon for that night for the show. We knew that the show was at the V theater but it took us a while to find the location of the V Theater and when we finally did there was no signage to indicate that there was a comedy show and a ridiculously long line to the ticket counter. Due to the amount of time it took us to find the location we didn't get to the theater until about 845p with a start time of 9pm. With no signage and no clear direction we had no choice but to stand in this long line.  It took about 40 minutes for us to get to the front of of the line which at this point the show had been going for 20 minutes and EVERYONE in line was as frustrated as we were. We decided we would still go to the show even though it was already a third over. When we finally got up to the counter the lady informed us that they only had 1 open seat so we both could not go in. I admit that I did not read the fine print that a reservation is recommended, but even if I had a reservation we still would have missed a good portion of the show due to their inability to get through the line in a timely manner. I bought the tickets on groupon and when I selected the specific time and date for the tickets I assumed I was getting a reservation.

My parents used to bring me and my brother here on the family trips to Vegas back in the day. I have to say, it looked the same from when I was a kid. Well, it looked smaller but that could be because I just grew. We decided to bring our 2 year old here on the way back to my moms house who lives in Vegas. It even seems they have the same carnival games as they did almost 15 years ago. We played a few of them and we won my son a few stuffed animals. My brother and I used to play those games where you drop your quarter in the slot and it is supposed to knock other quarters off the ledge. Well, most of those were not working or taped up so you could not play them. My son liked the huge Sponge Bob thing in front of the 4D ride they have now. My son really seemed to like it down there. Since my mom lives in Vegas we will probably bring him back when we are in town. But, that would be the only reason we go back to that run down hotel. I have a feeling that will be one of the next hotels on the strip to go. I guess if you have to stay there I see they have super cheap rates during the off season...like $29.00 cheap. 
I would go here again, but only for my son to play around down stairs. He had a good time and I would recommend for other parents with kids.

I must say, this is by far the best Microtel I have stayed in and I have probably stayed in ten or twelve different Microtel's. It is obvious that the hotel is fairly new...as other reviewers did state it is a totally non-smoking hotel, so if you are a smoker I would suggest requesting a first floor room to make going in and out a little easier. The lobby is very modernly decorated, bright, and welcoming.

Beds are very comfortable and soft- the only downside is that most Microtel's (including this one) don't usually have King beds- only single and double Queen rooms and suites. LCD HDTV's are also a big plus. Free Internet and phone calls anywhere in the Lower 48 is nice to save on those cell phone minutes. Upon checking in, the front desk employee was very polite and welcoming. Since this was a Tuesday night, the rate I received was an EXCELLENT value. Breakfast was excellent with eggs, sausage, and beacon as well as muffins and fruit. There is limited seating in the breakfast area, so I would imagine this is very crowded on the weekends and when the hotel is booked. 

This hotel is a little off the strip, so if you are planning on seeing all the sights, you need a car or rely on public transportation. The hotel is right across from the outlet Mall, which has over 100 stores as well as numerous fast food dining options all within walking distance.

So, now I know better, and I also know that the arguments rage on about whether Town Square is actually the ""Strip"" (I say ""no""... for now), but if there was one place on Las Vegas Boulevard that I wish would fulfill my naive 24/7 dreams, it's the little Godiva shop at Town Square.

What this city surprisingly lacks is a strong confectioner presence, but we do have a few good chocolatiers, and Godiva lives up to its established reputation for bringing the nummies.

Not every Godiva shop is alike, though. The one at the Venetian is always crowded and service is never remarkable at best. The one at Planet Hollywood (is it even still there?) seems to have a smaller selection. What's so great about the Godiva at Town Square?

Being in its own little storefront (and not essentially part of a mall) makes for a better traffic flow. The people who work there are always pleasant and never snooty, maybe because they deal with more locals than at other locations? I appreciate that the staff usually leaves you alone after saying hello, not following you around the tiny space and trying to show off products you can examine for yourself. Alas, the implication of ""usually"" is part of what keeps this review from being five stars. 

(The other item is price. Godiva makes silky, rich, reliable chocolates, and they don't have a lot of local competition for a similar level of product, but I still think their prices are more about preserving their aura of prestige than the quality of the product.)

Never mind the price of truffles, though, because what I like best of all are the (heavenly sigh) Chocolixirs! Even the name, Chocolixir, makes me feel like this is medicine for blue day. With caramel or raspberry or without, I've never had a poorly mixed one from this store. 

Strolling around Town Square on a breezy day, sipping a Milk Chocolate Decadence... I wish Thoreau could've lived to experience it.  One trip to Godiva and I always leave swearing that I'll never muck about with Frappuccinos ever again.

One word of recommendation: sign up for Godiva's chocolate club. You can do it in the store or online, and you'll get one of those little cards for your keychain, one that entitles you to a free piece of chocolate every month. (Or they can just look you up by email address when you pop by.) The Town Square people are often willing to box up your freebie, too, so you can focus on that delicious Chocolixir instead.

The only thing this place has going for it is the great food that several vendor eateries provided, but the Nugget has no involvement in that so let's break this down.

Upon arrival, I discovered that my room had neither a fridge nor a micro wave? In 2018? Really? What is this, Motel 6? Do you know how much it sucks to work 12-15 hour days and not have a fridge for a beer after work or a microwave to warm up leftovers? Wow! So I bought a large ice chest. Did I mention ice? So there is an ice machine near the elevators, that didn't work for the last 9 days of my stay. This meant I had to walk clear to the opposite end of the floor just to get ice daily! Boooooooooo! And I called to inform then and it never got fixed???? 
My birthday came in the middle of my 19 day work stay, so my wife drove out to surprise me and spend some time with me! After my stay was extended another day, I had an issue with my keys. I was on job site, and called in to make sure my wife, who was in their casino, wouldn't have the same issue I did. They assured me she was on the room record and would have no problem. Ten minutes later they treated my wife like a call girl trying to sneak into a ""johns"" room and embarrassed her publicly for several minutes. She called me, they wouldn't speak with my and denied her access. Boom!

The menu is loaded with lots of delicious items, the full breakfast fare plus burgers, sandwiches, and salads. We went with the smoked salmon benedict and the fried chicken benedict. 

Both were delicious. Fried chicken benedict was tasty, the sausage gravy very mild so add your own pepper. I enjoyed the smoked salmon as well, maybe more cream cheese. Hollandaise sauce was nice and light, not clumpy or heavy. I would have liked a slice of lemon to add some citrus to it. 

I heard the pancakes were great, and the plates that passed by would confirm that. I will be back again to try those.

It was around 11pm, which is apparently considered late night, even in Las Vegas, because the late night limited menu is what was available.  When we were seated, we were the only ones in the restaurant.  The seating area is nice, it's supposed to feel as if we're sitting outside on a Parisian patio, which it did.  Our server was helpful in explaining what our choices were on the menu, which were basically noodles and meat with peanut butter sauce, or noodles and meat in soup, as well as the dim sum cart.

I decided on the shrimp noodle soup.  It was just over $20, which seemed odd for one person, but I figured it must be an amazing noodle soup.  The dim sum cart lady came by and explained the dishes, although her English wasn't great and I only had a very basic understanding of what the dishes were, having never eaten dim sum.  I ordered the shrimp sticky rice balls (2 for $7.88) and she put them on the table and stamped our card.  They were okay, kind of weird tasting, and I wouldn't order them again.

My soup came out not long after and was basically a bowl of ramen noodles, 6 or 7 shrimp, green onions and cabbage.  (They had apparently forgotten I asked for no cabbage, although they remembered no cilantro).  The broth was pretty flavorless and really just tasted like water.  I had to add soy sauce and the spicy red sauce from the table to make it enjoyable to eat.  Honestly, homemade Top Ramen noodles in the plastic package at the grocery store is much more flavorful and way cheaper.

Our server was attentive until I got my food, then she was nowhere to be seen.  Keep in mind there was only one other table occupied in the entire place.  I had to flag down the manager who was chatting with other servers to ask for the check.  When he brought it, I had been charged for two portions of dim sum, even though I clearly only had one.  Then I had to wait to flag down our server and wait for her to fix the check before we could pay and leave.  $30 for a flavorless bowl of soup and rice balls was way overpriced, even for Vegas.

Knowing full well that they expected 60 days written notice of moving out, and that I went over the 60 day date, I sent the complex a notice through the resident website portal on March 5th that I planned to leave. Having not heard or received any confirmation after a few weeks, I called the office and was told they never received my notice and that I would be charged for two months rent as well as for breaking my lease (even though it would have been up by then). According to them, and very conveniently for them, they never received my notice. I'm still trying to grapple with how them not receiving something through their portal was on me. I was then informed (which is stated nowhere in my lease), that I would have to come to the office and fill out a form in order for them to accept my notice. So, I did. Fast-forward to the day before move-out, when I had scheduled a walkthrough and nobody showed. I left the place in tip-top shape (and have pics to prove) and the keys to my outdoor, unlocked, deadbolted apartment on the counter. A few days later, after calling several times and leaving a message for the manager to return my call, and NEVER hearing anything back...I got a voicemail that my apartment needed to undergo an annual inspection and that they couldn't get in and that I would be charged for having to drill the lock off my door! In the nearly one month that I have not lived there, I have called and asked to speak with the manager, Jimmy, several times, but to no avail. Nobody will return my call, yet I have been billed $1500+. I have always been, and will always be an exemplary tenant and feel this is highway robbery.

I am a very methodical person and backwards engineered the various proposals to come up with comparable prices between all the builders as many will not give you a detailed breakout because they don't want you to compare.

After doing all this, I chose Sylvan based on the design as well as the salesperson (Bob Mertel). I will tell you up front that they are not the cheapest, but they were the second cheapest and I am willing to pay a little more for quality and that is exactly what I got.

They were on top of the project from day 1 and they pushed my pool through in about 6 weeks. Amazing...especially considering I has a built in BBQ and about 1400 square feet of pavers included in that work.

Bob was awesome. Whenever I had an issue, I called his cell, and he ANSWERED. Every phone call I made was answered, even at 10pm. I am not exaggerating...I never went to voice mail.

The project manager was also great (Skye). He works best via text message and ALWAYS got me a quick answer and addressed all my concerns.

Very satisfied with Anthony Sylvan and I highly recommend. Also FYI...my project was a complex one.

It's not on the dinner menu, but I was told you can order dimsum from the kitchen late night for $2.88 each. The selection is limited and depends on what didn't sell that morning. Hey, it's better than nothing....the only late night dimsum (Kan's) closed. 

We ended up getting:

Shrimp Har Gao- the shrimp and wrapper was fine, but I think the wrapper is slightly too thick.
Shumai- I did not like their version. Something about the taste just doesn't work for me and was just OK. 
Shrimp cake- these were tasty. They were panfried so it was crisp and inside was dense cake, shrimp and green onion. 

We also got off the menu:

Mapo Tofu ($7.95)- pretty good. The meat had a sausage like flavor to it which was interesting since most just throw plain ground meat. Tofu is always noms to me.

Salt&Pepper Pork Chop ($9.95)- the fry was light so the texture was nice. Funny that ""salt"" is part of the name, but it needed a tad more of that. 

I was surprised by the prices. I honestly thought it would be more at a casino, but it's about the same pricing as some of the nicer Chinese restaurant on Spring Mountain Rd. I think it was very fair priced and the quality was good.

I called to ask about prices and later make an appointment and I don't think I've ever talked to anyone that cheerful over the phone. 

Amanda did my nails and she was great. She was knowledgeable and really took the time with my pedicure. I don't think I've ever had someone concentrate on my nails so much before. 

My sister got her manicure done by Shaun and had a similar positive experience where she was very pleasantly surprised about how much time and care went into her basic manicure.

I've heard of it, but we're not around this area often, but decided to head down. I've been looking for some new Mexican eateries. 

The food is more Yucatan region judging from some of their menu offerings and the way they cook their staples. It's a bit different from what I'm used to, but I liked it. 

I got a combo of chicken tamales and chicken enchiladas (which comes with red sauce but I asked for green) and the fiance got cheese enchilada and chicken tamale. The tamale was stuffed with chicken and had a tomato sauce over it. I think I prefer a bit more masa, but this was quality. Enchilada also was plentiful with chicken in it and I enjoyed their green sauce. The beans is more pureed than what I do and had a interesting roasty flavor about it. Rice was standard, but good.

The service was friendly and good. We both appreciated that we were able to sub minor things in our combo with no problems. We were checked on often and drinks were refilled.We came at not a busy time, and in the areas where people weren't sitting, some of the staff were doing some cleaning and prepping before dinner. Definitely appreciate a place that is cleaning daily.

I'll definitely be back. It's not the style of Mexican food I grew up with, but it's nice to shake it up sometimes.

Aram along with Hi-Tech's auto team were able to fix my car completely, replace the front bumper with a fresh white paint job to match the car color too. They also completely fixed my headlight issue, and the reason it was out for so long was due to a wiring issue Aram was able to locate with ease. 

The craziest part about their hard work was they were able to do it in such quick, efficient time.

I can't believe I have driven past this place countless times and failed to see it. What a hidden gem in Chinatown. I know you're thinking, an Argentinian restaurant in Chinatown that's legit?! Well yes, yes it is. It's also a deli and mini market. Upon entering you'll see a huge display deli case full of meats, cheeses, empanadas etc, to the right is a mini market that sells various dry goods, drinks etc. 

Our server who greeted us upon entering told us to sit where we liked and she took our drink order right away. We pretty much knew what we wanted to order but we browsed the menu anyway. I'm curious about the Italian dishes they serve but I'm almost certain we will be ordering the grilled meats again. We were brought some bread and chimichurri upon menu browsing. I'm a little disappointed it wasn't warmed or toasted but the chimichurri made up for it. Flavorful oil with herbs and garlic. Just be careful to not to over indulge you will get full quick. Take my word for it ;) 

We went ahead and ordered the Parrillada Martin Fierro which consists of kalbi,skirt steak, flap meat and filet mignon. We also added sausage since I didn't come with it. Also and two orders of Spanish rice which is a la carte. One order was not enough for the both of us. We came hungry though.  

They brought over the meat feast and man oh man! I can't state how much I enjoyed this. Cooked a perfect medium so it was still juicy and pink inside. So delicious yet seasoned simply so the meat can stand on its own. My favorite was the filet but all the meats were really good. At one point in the meal my fiancé mentioned he was meat wasted! In a good way of course. Drizzle the meat with chimichurri and eat it with the rice that soak up the juices from the meat. Honestly it was the best meal I've had in a long time and my mouth is watering just reminiscing. I will definitely be back to try the other meat platters as to decide which one is my favorite.

My experience, however, with JW's has been really good and this place just does not rise to that level. Rooms are nice, quiet, and large but decor is a bit dated. Restaurant choices are not that good. Food selection from the poolside kitchen is very limited and disappointing for a ""spa"". I didn't mind that it was far from the strip, in fact, that was a draw for me. Children's activities are limited to the pool (which doesn't have a lazy river or slide) and a volleyball court.

Initially it might seem bizarre to be served by waitresses in cosplay costumes; however my friends and I thought the anime oil paintings and their showing of the spirited away accompanied well with our meal. 

I enjoyed our meal very much-we each ordered our own servings of ramen and shared butakimchi fried rice and Japanese chicken pizza. I wouldn't recommend coming here for authentic japanese cuisine (i.e. sushi, sashimi, fish) because that is not what they are known for. Regardless, it is a a decent joint for a casual sit down meal of ramen and side dishes. Their ramen noodles had a nice QQ quality and soups were flavorful. I highly recommend the butakimchi fried rice. Although it doesn't taste anything like kimchi fried rice, it has an incredibly rich flavor that I could get enough of! Japanese chicken pizza was good but not particularly special because it tasted/resembled more like bbq chicken pizza than traditional okonomiyaki. Overall, we had a great time watching anime while slurping on yummy noodies.

The restaurant is located on the smaller section of Chinatown (plaza that has Ten Ren/Tea Station and Ichiza izakaya; The location is convenient for driving and is only a $10 taxi ride from the Strip.

The waitress was very friendly and explained away whatever question was fired off at her by the group.  For the remainder of our meal she never let the coffee run empty or cold.

We all ordered something that had gravy poured on it.  Not brown gravy but the southern kind that sticks to the ribs.  A field test was conducted and a utensil was inserted into said gravy and then inverted where it seemed to defy gravity by clinging to the implement.

First thing that popped in my head was eating at a Hawaiian place, but I didn't feel like driving down Rainbow to get it.  i was on my way to get my husband for lunch when I saw this place in the same strip mall near an Albertsons.  I figured, ""why not?"" and went inside.

It's fairly small so there isn't much seating, but from the looks of things people order take out A LOT.  That's a good sign.  I checked out their menu, and it's nice and simple.  It's the same menu I've seen at several Hawaiian bbq restaurants around town, so I went for the usual chicken katsu with steamed rice and my husband ordered fried shrimp and their seafood platter.  

Despite having several dozen options for Hawaiian bbq around town, this one is now on my list of favorites.  Their fried foods are awesome and not greasy like some places, and their batter has great flavor.  I love panko breaded anything, and their katsu and fried seafood is all panko.  I loved that their katsu sauce, whether it's from a bottle or not, is sweeter than the other places, but still has that nice tangy finish with a bit of heat.  

We tried their kalua pig and other things on the menu a few days after and it was all good, even when doing take out.  Their mac salad is good, too, and different because they add tuna in theirs.  They are known for their oxtail soup, which I will try eventually.  Overall, it's a great stop for some good Hawaiian fast food.  I actually prefer them over the other places around the northwest area.  

Clean, friendly. and fast.  They may not have the dessert menu that some other Hawaiian bbq places have, but do you really go there for the cake and ice cream?  No. You go there for a simple, fast meal that's good, and they do it well.

Stop by and try out their food.  Some people may argue that it's like the other Hawaiian bbq places because of the menu, but this place tastes better, cleaner, and less greasy.  That, and their employees give great service.

Give this place a try if you live in the area.  I know the location looks fishy because of the stores next to it and it's in this tiny strip mall building, but it is good.  I even questioned myself because I tend to stay away from places like that...at least, I used to.  I've learned that these places, despite location, can fork out some of the best food you will eat in Vegas, so give it a try.

I've had the # 2 chicken arepas- shredded chicken, tomatoes, garlic, onion (the hot filling one, there is a cold chicken filling one too, which is totally different) three times before writing this review. My husband's had the beef - bell pepper, onion, tomato, garlic, and the pork arepas- shredded pork butt, tomato slices, on two separate occasions- he said they are both so good, he is not sure which one is his favorite! Ok, I am addicted to these hearty venezuelan cornmeal sandwiches and at roughly $4.00 each, it's cheap eats meets hole in the wall, though there aren't technically any walls to speak of, haha. Just one fills me up. I keep forgetting to use the sauces, but they stand up on their own, so much flavor! On the weekend, if my husband asks ""What are we having for dinner?"" This place immediately comes to mind. 

We also tried the $2.00 empanadas, but these are puffy and deep-fried- more like a doughnut, different than Filipino ones (sweet dough, ground beef, diced vegetables, and raisins- more like a meal pocket)- which I prefer, guess it's a childhood thing, too. I'm curious about the drinks. I'll have to try it one day. 

Guess this place has done really well, though, because they are going to be opening up the former BBQ place down the street, the corner of Las Vegas Blvd. and Oakey. Not sure if they are keeping this little corner place, though. One time, my husband noticed that a couple from California was eating here, so I know that this place has gotten proper exposure in the Yelp world (over 150 reviews). The website still needs updating, as there are no sunday hours listed. Relax, take a deep breath, it's really open on sundays. Maybe the popularity changed their operating hours.

I'm a big fan of Hubert Keller and had recently eaten at Burger Bar and really enjoyed my experience there.  So, I was really looking forward to an excellent food experience at Fleur.  From the start, I was mildly disappointed.  The hostess wasn't very friendly, and the restaurant itself had an overly  casual bar feel to it.  It was also loud for a while because there was a live band playing just across the way.  The menu of small and large plates is huge with many exciting options, but  unfortunately many fell flat for me.  The lobster mac and cheese was way too mild and not very flavorful.  The duck was really tender but could have used more zing to the flavors.  The accompanying braised veggies ( rhubarb, celery, and chipolini onion) were not appetizing at all - they looked limp and were oily and flavorless.  My favorite was the garlic fries which were incredibly rich due to the truffle oil.  The service was inconsistent.  Drinks were not refilled after the first refill, and it took an unexpectedly long time for extra things that were requested (e.g., lime) to be brought to the table.  The serviced really dropped off toward the end of the meal when we felt a bit overlooked.  There also seemed to be problems with expediting the food in a reasonable time period.

The atmosphere is great with cool decor and amazing service. We sat at the bar because unfortunately they do not take reservations. But the bartenders who helped us were hilarious and very attentive. It was my friends 21st birthday and they gave us some free shots. We first ordered the fireball chicken wings and they were one of my favorite things, such a good spicy sweet hot sauce. We also had the nachos and crispy tuna tacos and they were okay, I would skip those. But the Mac and cheese burger was soooooo good with crispy bacon and amazing gooey mac and cheese. Oh and last but not least we had the cheesecake with potato chips and pretzels that was absolutely amazing, I have an obsession with salty sweet desserts.

Dinner began with a killer watermelon cocktail with whiskey.  I should of only had one; however, chose to have 3, maybe 4?  We then split the bone marrow appetizer.  It was an interesting presentation, very Fred Flintstonesque.  It may have been a tad too rich for me but was tasty.  They also lacked marrow spoons to facilitate eating the meat.

I then had the best iceberg wedge salad of my life.  The dressing was yogurt based and the bacon was cut into cubes fried and served hot.  It was a massive portion clearly enough for 2.  It was yummy.

Entrée was shrimp with grits.  It was exceptional once again and something I will eat again.

You totally get the vibe that the room was supposed to be a live-in condo due to it's amenities and hallway set up. It actually feels like a home opposed to a hotel room. The biggest difference between the wraparound and regular terrace rooms is the size of the balcony. Holy cow, you get a full panoramic view. The bathroom is also set up very nicely..his and her sinks with a huge soaking tub and stand-alone shower. They definitely didn't cut corners when it came to the rooms!

I dipped my rating down to 4 stars due to the casino...if you're a seasoned gambler, the casino is way too small and has a poor layout. The sportsbook is tucked away far from the casino and is very tiny as well. I played more at PH and Bellagio when I stay at the Cosmo.

Everything was tasty with the Pork/Shrimp and Scallop/Pork being my favorites. The gold foil on the Pork and Shrimp Siu Mai was a nice touch. They're decent dumplings, but certainly not the best ones I've had. I probably wouldn't order these again because the noodle dishes certainly stand out more.

Crispy Bao Bun ($9.88): Slow-cooked Pork Belly, pickled vegetables, peanuts, and cilantro. The bao was nice, but I didn't care for the filling. Nothing stood out about the ingredients.

Lo Mein ($14.88): Hand-pulled wheat noodles, ham, forest mushrooms, carrot, Napa cabbage, scallion, soy sauce, and cilantro. The noodles were fantastically chewy and it was an overall flavorful dish.

Dan Dan Mian ($14.88): Hand-cut noodles, spicy pork sauce, cucumber, carrot, watermelon radish, cilantro, and Chinkiang vinegar. I really enjoyed his dish. I loved the spicy pork sauce reminiscent of Jajangmyeon (black bean noodles) and all the vegetables.

Crispy Ocean Noodle ($24.88): Egg noodles, head-on prawns, snow peas, Shiitake mushroom, and Chinese gravy. This was my favorite dish of the bunch. I love crispy noodle dishes and this was delicious. Also, the prawns were wonderful.

Taiwanese Shaved Ice (Large; $8.88): Coconut snow, condensed milk, fresh strawberries, toasted coconut, and mochi. I highly recommend the shaved ice (or shaved snow). This is probably the best Taiwanese Shaved Ice I've had. Really light, airy, and equally creamy. Wonderful flavor and I loved the toppings! It was also nice to eat out of a large bowl, so the shaved ice was nicely contained.

Overall, I think the food is really nice. Though the prices are a bit high for dishes that I didn't absolutely love; which is why I find it difficult to return frequently.

Dr. Monroe is a fantastic doctor, my mother and I both think very highly of her. Her office staff, however, are absolutely terrible.

I've actually hung up and called back with in 2 minutes and I get an answering service in the middle of the day. They say they are open Monday thru Friday, which has been no where near the truth. I have also spoken to the office manager and she has the worst attitude of them all. I can't say going in there is ever a decent experience because of this. The level of professional is not even at mediocre.  She had also prescribed me an ultrasound in an outside radiology office who informed me Monroe should have the results in the next 2 days. Monroe told me she would call me when she gets them with a plan of action. None of this happened. I finally had to call to get results, only to be called back with a prescription from office staff, not the doctor, and still no explanation. I have now been trying to get a refill on a separate prescription to no avail and no explanation. My pharmacy has also tried to contact them multiple times with the same result. I don't know if something is going on but I at the least should be given some kind of explanation.

The warehouse has 26 axe throwing lanes. You sign a waiver, receive a safety speech, and the instructor shows you different types of throws you can perform. They have add on options as well when you arrive. We purchased (2) mystery boxes which had prizes in them and we won two show tickets and a hair blowout. We also purchased a set of knives to learn how to throw those. 

The staff is friendly and very helpful. They don't hover over you which was also really nice, they taught our group how to throw and kind of left us on our own for the remaining time to have fun. The axes aren't as easy as they make it look however! The knife throwing was a great addition for our group, broke up the two hours another new experience for our party. 

They have a rage room where you can beat the crap out of things for 20 minutes with a bat which I found so funny!

I work in this area and have noticed this restaurant on visits to the Starbuck's next door. People at work said it was good, but I'm not typically looking for dinner spots in this area. Well, tax time came and we had an evening appointment down the street. If my husband had to leave work at a decent hour for our appointment then I was definitely making him take me to dinner. :)

Since I didn't know how long our appointment would last I didn't make a reservation. This was no problem at all for an early dinner and we were seated right away. The restaurant didn't start to fill up until around 7. 

Our sweet waitress greeted us right away and ran over the specials with us as well. She was very attentive with help from other servers as well. We were checked on regularly and our plates were cleared quickly. They did so without being obtrusive or rushing service.

The bread basket included several types of bread, all delicious. I started with the Arugula salad. The individual flavors were nice, but I didn't love the citrus dressing. My husband started with the Oysters, Rockefeller style and really enjoyed it.

My entrée was the star of the show. I had the Seared Sea Scallops. The scallops were perfectly prepared and seasoned nicely. The whole dish came together so well. I loved the sautéed spinach and orange sauce around the scallops. The mashed potatoes were creamy and flavorful with a nice large portion. The mixed vegetables had a truly nice mix of vegetables that were all prepared well with a nice amount of seasoning. My entrée was incredible and a very generous portion. 

My husband had the special which was Elk which was served with a delicious sauce on top, rice and mixed vegetables on the side. I normally don't like elk, but this was prepared in a way that I really enjoyed. The elk had a nice seasoned crust and the meat was tender and flavorful. The sauce on top paired perfectly. My husband also loved his entrée and said he enjoyed the vegetables on the side!

Even though I should have passed on dessert I just couldn't pass it up. Every dessert option sounded amazing and there was only one boring option (crème brulee). Everything else was interesting. The chocolate peanut butter pie was perfectly rich. The peanut butter was very rich, but the chocolate toned it down perfectly. The honeycomb on the top was very unique and definitely added something to the flavor. The lime tart didn't hold back on tang and the lemon curd on the side was refreshing.

This was one of those meals where I left wanting to recommend this restaurant to everyone I know.",4/5/2016 3:48,36.1155323,-115.0934543,3762 E Flamingo Rd,NV,Las Vegas,89121,"Mexican, Restaurants",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,La Takiza

It's centrally located in the heart of the strip and despite the recent renovations next door, it still fits in great. I can't eat at any other cafe. Seriously, their food is so good. From their country fried steak to their chicken carbonara. So delicious! Any of their dishes appease any craving that I have. The dishes have always been cooked to perfection (except for the ONE time my hash browns were a little over-done, but it's cool). Other than that, nothing compares to their cafe for the price.

Their customer service has always been outstanding. The staff is always pleasant and accommodating. IF something does go wrong, they always do their best to fix it.

For those of you who enjoy gambling like myself, the MC is great. I'm a slotty gal so can't say much for the tables, but they have machines that range from $.05 to $5. Can't say the same for Aria next door. $10 video poker?! I ran right back to MC.

The rooms I have stayed in were always clean. I also tip the maids regardless if they come into my room during my stay. If everyone at least left them a few bucks to show appreciation, it'd go a long way. Oh yeah, tip the cocktail waitresses too. $1 a drink is my rule. It's just a classy thing to do.

All in all, MC is my #1 hotel in Vegas. Affordable, awesome food, friendly staff, and great for gambling. I tend to never leave MC because I'm usually disappointed with the other options.

I pass this place quite often, but was kinda leery due to the plaza that it was located in but thought to give it a try anyway.

Our favorite place (Layers) recently closed and we hoped this would become the go to spot now. Came twice on a weekend since they opened. While I understand it takes time to work out all the details in a new place, something needs to be done about the service. When you walk in there's a sign stating to go to the right counter to be seated. It's hard to see it right away and most people just wait at the door further blocking the sign. The staff doesn't really do anything about it and you need to catch someone to get a table. No fun when you waiting with kids. When finally seated both times took a while for someone to come by. On a second visit once we finally ordered, few minutes later another waiter came by to say he will be our server and what would we like. We said we just ordered. Again took time for drinks and only water came. Server forgot our coffee until we flagged her down. It was nicely comped later as apology for the wait. The waitress just seemed not to care at all. She made some weird comments when I was ordering my son's breakfast along the line ""you sure that's what you want for him"", not even half way through our meal asked if we are ready for our check, and asked two more times, until we finally said yes. Another server brought our food including small bowl of fruit. I asked if that's part of the kids meal and he said ""yeah"". During the first visit, we did get fruit with the kids chicken meal, so I thought that was the case again. Turned out I was charged for it and the waitress just said ""which guy told you that"". It doesn't matter, she took my order and I did not ask for it in a first place. Also, she never gave us itemized bill until my husband paid and it just seemed too much. Once I asked, she printed a copy which showed the charge for the fruit. While the food is good with quality ingredients and nice presentation (hence the 2 stars), the overall experience was not pleasant either time, and we won't be back.",11/8/2015 5:47,36.23814609,-115.1515048,"725 W Craig Rd, Ste 132",NV,North Las Vegas,89032,"Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Japanese, Hawaiian",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Teriyaki Madness

The person on the phone said they couldn't give me a price until I came in for a consultation because they had to see me in person to know. So I show up for the consultation. They bring me to an office with a sales lady. Immediately the lady starts talking to me about laser hair removal as if that was the main thing I was there for. She is selling me on laser hair removal because she said it helps lighten the skin as well with the skin bleaching. I asked her if the laser hair removal hurts because pain is a big concern for me. She said not at all. They have the lastest technology and it doesn't hurt. She starts doing math with her calculator and talking pricing. I thought it was weird she still didn't actually look at my areas of concern like they mentioned on the phone they had to do to give me a price. The consultation is not to see what's best for you personally it's to sell you the best way they can with the most procedures they can. And if you don't have the money don't worry they will talk you into signing up for their credit card. I ended up signing over my life because it all sounded good but the experience gets even worse. I set up a payment plan for $2580 for 6 skin bleaching and 12 laser treatments. After signing the contract I did my first session of the hair removal. The lady seemed like she was in a rush. It lasted less than 1 minute. I'm almost positive she didn't even get the areas (THAT I PAID FOR). And I know for a fact she didn't because it hurt and I could feel every area she went to. So thanks for lying about no pain. During the procedure the technician also told me herself that (the more it hurts the better it works.) Funny during the consultation the first lady didn't mention this. I guess she just told me whatever I needed to hear... just as long as I signed my life away. Once the laser hair removal session was over I went to the skin bleaching room with another tech. The skin bleaching was a way better experience. Although I was also told I didn't feel anything with this procedure either there was a tingling discomfort. No big deal. Then the lady mentions I would definitely need more than 6 sessions. I just don't understand why they didn't tell me this during the consultation!!!!!! Isn't that the whole point of having one? She might as well say ""Oh yea eventually we're going to need more money from you."" After everything was done I told the staff in the lobby I don't want to do the laser hair removal anymore because it hurt. They wouldn't take no for an answer though. They tell me I can use the numbing cream for my next session. They didn't mention if it would be extra for that ...which i'm sure it will be. It's just a very sketchy business here. I'm glad I recorded the conversation we had in the consultation room on my phone just incase I need to prove anything. I was promised a lot of things. How can you guarantee that it will only take 12 sessions for my hair to be completely gone when the technician isn't getting all of the areas?!? I feel completely ripped off. Probably worst service I've had in all the 12 years I've lived in Vegas. The staff was very nice until you realize they lie. They withhold certain information and that's not right.

I ended up at the Luxor and, despite what a lot of people on the page are saying, it's actually a pretty sweet place.

Yeah, it's showing its age. That happens. It's called aging. I can forgive that kind of stuff when the staff makes up for it - and the Luxor staff treated me like a pampered prince, festooned with gems and rare rubies. 

It was my first time in Vegas, and the woman at the counter was extremely polite while answering my inane questions about the area. Something as simple as that totally made me relax to the max.

The room was a hotel room. Nothing too fancy (considering I paid less than $100 a night) but nothing alarming. My bed was soft and my shower was hot. Dreamy!

I'll agree with everyone else that wifi is sorely needed. The ethernet jack was helpful, but it would have been nice to not have a big cord to step over as I moved around the room. 

In short, it's a well-priced place to stay if you want to rock Vegas and save a few dimes. Will likely stay there again in a few months when I roll back for another conference.

Each patron will be given an edible menu held together by a ring and served with a side of apricot sauce. It is a very unique visual presentation but unnecessary to finish. Listed on the menu is a prix-fixe three course menu. My friend split the three course with mango sorbet, Mount Fiji, and cream puff. 

Our first course was the mango sorbet which arrived in a scoop with a generous strip of mint jelly down the middle. Any mango lovers would enjoy this smooth sorbet with a blatant and tangy flavor. Mount Fiji was a chestnut cream cake with thin slices of chocolate wafer pieces. The flavors were delightfully light but I'm generally not a fan of heavily-creamed desserts. Our last course was the chocolate cream puff with vanilla custard and a side of strawberry and mango jelly. The tangy jelly pieces was a good contradiction of the sweet cream puff which was freshly baked. 

We were so pleased with the above that we even added another dessert, the Stella. It was a strawberry tiramisu with seasonal raspberry sorbet. Rather than being a typical tiramisu sprinkled with coffee powder and flavored with cocoa, it was done so with strawberry and a much lighter mascarpone cheese. It was beautifully formed like a flower.   

With dessert made fresh before our eyes, a $19 prix-fixe three course dessert menu is definitely my thing!",3/1/2015 23:29,36.17125047,-115.1462639,1 Fremont St,NV,Las Vegas,89101,"Casinos, Event Planning & Services, Arts & Entertainment, Hotels & Travel, Delis, Diners, Hotels, Restaurants",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,Hotels,Entertainment,Restaurants_FoodHotelsEntertainment,Golden Gate Hotel & Casino

Had a great experience.  We got dressed up and did the whole 9 yard. So for our anniversary  we travel to Vegas . We figured hey it's a little pricey but what the heck. Let's go for it and splurge.  We both got dressed nice. Her in a fine black cocktail dress. Myself in a sport blazer,pants and a headdress. Recently I have be wearing my hair long so it keeps it nice and neat, tied back and out of my face. We were staying at Bellagio and wore something very similar to Picasso for dinner the night before. Not a single problem there.  And was treated with the utmost respect and services.  Not at Vic and Anthony steakhouse Vegas. Don't worry we will get to the food very shortly. The hostess sat us down and asked me to remove my hat in the dining room.  I told her it's not a hat it's a headdress.  She walked away.  Than the waiter came to take our order and asked, ""Would the gentleman kindly remove your hat?"" I told him it was not a hat and this gentleman would like not to be asked again.  Than the manager came and as me to remove it. I told him that this headdress is culturally accept around the world and is also used by many religious group and can be very offensive if asked to be removed.  He looked at me like I drew the race card on him. I noticed how the whole senerio was making the evening unpleasant for my wife so I reluctant removed it. Than we noticed a older man in jeans and a cowboy had behinds us. To the right of us a group of people in shorts and t shirts.  You know the ones with the US flag on it. The food was  2nd rate.

PARKING: I think they have their own private lot, as it is inside the Ellis Island Hotel and Casino. I ended up just walking here because my hotel was right behind it.

LOCATION: Located inside Ellis Island. You'll see it past the casino, right beside the karoke bar.

RESERVATIONS: I think you can make reservations through Yelp, but I saw that there was no wait time, so I ended up coming here without a reservation. Once I got to the hostess, she told me that there was about 45 minutes for 3 people, which I thought was kind of dumb, but I decided to wait anyway. I ended up getting seated within 15 minutes!

RESTAURANT: Very casual dine-in kind of restaurant. It kind of reminds me of a typical casino cafe in Vegas. You just come to grab a quick meal for the night. There were plenty of booths and long tables for large parties. My friends and I got our own booth.

MENU: I was very impressed with the selection of food which varies from burgers to pasta, but my attention was drawn towards their prime rib special for about $17.99. The special came with a side of green beans, and a choice of mashed or baked potatoes or french fries, and soup or salad. It may not sound a lot, but it's actually enough to share between two people.

I ended up sharing mine with my roommate, and we barely ate through half of the prime rib. The prime rib was large and cooked a nice medium rare for us. I thought it was very tender and juicy, not bad for the cheap price! The mashed potatoes were delicious; the gravy was savory and tasted amazing with the potatoes. The green beans were okay and the salad was standard.

CONCLUSION: Definitely a decent place to stop by if you're staying nearby. The prime rib special is hard to pass, considering how much food they give you and the quality isn't so bad either! Good for leftovers as well if you're planning to save a little extra money in Vegas.

As for the menu, there was so much to choose from.  From burgers to egg sandwiches to tacos to fish and chips.  I ordered the charbroiled chicken supreme without bacon combo meal, to go. Pleasantly surprised!!! The quality of the food was better than expected. The fries were PERFECTLY cooked and crispy. A generous amount was in the bag. The chicken was well seasoned and cooked properly. The sandwich comes with avocado and Man did it come with avocado!!!! I love avocados and was expecting a couple of slices like most places would serve but it seemed like it came with an entire avocado. Thick piece of tomato. The bun was warm as well. 
Also, I asked alot of questions when I got there and the staff was very pleasant and seemed to really like their jobs which makes a difference in how you are being served. Very friendly and helpful.

We sat in the 'main' dining room, not the area with the bar and band and it was a much better ambience. We wanted to explore some new menu items and our server, Chandler was extremely helpful and knowledgeable.

Last time we drank champagne, but this time around we explored the cocktail menu. My wife opted for the Femme Fatale and I the Whiskey Smash. Both of our selections were so good that we continued with the same drinks all night.

For starters, we had the Brioche rolls and Shrimp Cocktail. The shrimp is served with a foam on top that definitely adds another dimension of flavor. The Caviar Tacos came highly recommended and did not disappoint! 

Next up was the Macaroni and Cheese, King Crab Dip, and Crispy Pork Belly. All of the flavors and textures were spot on and we truly enjoyed every bite. 

We couldn't say no to dessert and tried the Roasted Pineapple and the Apple Butter Cheesecake. The pineapple was my favorite.

I am a Real Estate Broker from California and I was introduced to Kym Booke by a mutual client.  My client raved about Kym's dedication and determination to provide the best service and relentless pursuit of doing whatever it takes to get the best results for her clients.

Well, after meeting Kym, I understood what our mutual client was talking about.  Kym is a dynamo and is absolutely selfless in her focus on helping other people.  She is so clearly focused on getting to the client's needs and desires that she goes so far above and beyond the normal call of duty for a Realtor.  

So, I referred Kym a client.  My client was so outrageously happy with Kym's professionalism, market expertise, and her ""can do"", ""will do"", and ""just get it done"" approach that my client asked if she could work with her all of the time!  To say that I will continue to recommend Kym is an understatement.  She is my only call to make in Las Vegas.  I know she will do what is best for my client every time.  

I say if you are looking to buy or sell real estate in the Las Vegas area, the first call you should make is to Kym Booke.  Once you talk to her, you will realize it's the only call you need to make!

We arrived there and I ordered the Sea Bass and my husband, the pork chops.  Both entrees came with a green salad with balsamic vinaigrette or Caesar salad - both salad dressings were home made.
Both the entrees and salads were delicious.  The pork chops were crusted after marinated in papaya and cherry wine which made then very tender.  Pan fried peppers and mushrooms covered the chops. The sea bass was in a white wine sauce with sauteed cabbage/peppers/carrots which was an odd combination but very tasty!  The potatoes on both entrees were seasoned, crusted and not overbearing.
The very creamy cheesecake was a great ending!  I also loved the crusty bread.

A long story short, I called this morning at 8 am (same time that they opened), I was number 2 in queue, and when I was number 1 in queue my call was forwarded to a voicemail.  I left a voicemail & over an hour later there was (of course) no returned phone call.  I walked into the office shortly after realizing that their voicemail serves little to no purpose, I talked to the lady at the front desk.  I told her I had called when they opened, left a voicemail, and did they have any appointments available for today?  She stated the availability, however, they conflicted with all of my class schedule times.  Since they only do same day appointments, she informed me that I'd have to call again the next day and (more than likely) go through the same process.

A word of advice, please don't waste your time with these incompetent ""medical"" office staff, as it appeared that they had a better time joking and laughing behind the front desk then assisting those who are ill.",1/16/2018 18:29,36.1400558,-115.1737005,2801 Westwood Dr,NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Strip Clubs, Adult Entertainment, Food, Tours, Party & Event Planning, Dance Clubs, Hotels & Travel, Bars, Caterers, Nightlife, Party Supplies, Event Planning & Services, Steakhouses, Wedding Planning, Restaurants",Restaurants,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,Hotels,Entertainment,Restaurants_FoodHotelsEntertainment,Treasures Gentlemen's Club & Steakhouse

I was here for Tiesto on New Years weekend, so I assume about as hard a night to enter as any.

- Buy tickets ahead of time if available.  I bought thru Wantickets thru the XS website and they had a separate entrance set up where I walked right in despite arriving at XS around 12:30AM (my plane landed that night at 11:15PM).  Didn't even have to grease the guy at the door, which I fully expected to have to do since I got there kinda late and this is standard practice at some NYC clubs, even if you have a ticket.

- Dress nice.  Really nice.  But leave the $500 loafers at home.  Wear the $150 ones.

- Forget bottle service.  Drink prices aren't THAT bad (under $15 for Tanqueray and tonic) and you can get service quickly enough in the outside bars.

Besides that it's your standard high-end club experience.  Lots of people, some more banged up than others, close quarters, lots of rich Asians (not a bad thing), but as XS you don't have the college crowd/mindset of wearing as much neon as possible and acting like a complete a-hole like you do in the majority of big clubs, festivals these days.  So HUGE ups for that.",1/3/2013 16:08,36.10033336,-115.0675308,4850 E Tropicana Ave,NV,Las Vegas,89121,"Bagels, Food, Donuts, Bakeries, Coffee & Tea",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Winchell's Donut House

The people at the front door are rude and lie to you about what to expect inside - promising things like free shots for birthdays which is not true. The space itself is small which I guess makes it seem like there are more people there since it was pretty empty. Drinks are expensive but that is just Vegas. The bartenders and everyone who works there are rude - not in the fun way Coyote Ugly is supposed to be rude but mean and make you feel like you just want to leave. Don't even think about going to the bathroom or getting a drink of water.. since the location has neither within the bar and you have to go into the hotel and put up with the harassing bouncers to get back in. I was told they could loose their job if they gave you a glass of water? What? They really need to take a second look at their hospitality. So my advice is SKIP it and go to another place!

My group was able to get a table near the live entertainment which was great. I didn't get the name of the entertainer, but he sang a lot of covers to some popular songs. 

The lounge was packed with a great, high energy crowd. When you walk in there is a floor to ceiling shelf unit separating the front bar space from the back lounge area. If you walk behind the shelf unit, it opens up to the main lounge space. In the center of the lounge space are some table games with dealers and a small stage against the back wall. There is a bar on either side of the large shelf unit. There are a few tables to the side of the main stage (where we sat) and bike with a DJ booth attached. Along one whole side of the venue are other VIP Tables. 

They played a lot of good Mexican music that night in addition to the live performer. The crowd went crazy when they started playing songs by the late Tejano singer, Selena.

We ordered a few of the grand opening special cocktails which for the life of me I cannot remember the name, but they were just okay. We also had a few drink tickets we used for house margaritas. They are served on the rocks and they don't salt the rim. I am not sure if this can be requested, but it definitely isn't standard.

We were able to order chips and salsa, but I was disappointed they were not offering any other food options that night. I can imagine it had something to do with how busy they were for the grand opening, but would have been nice to at least have a limited menu just to try the food. 

Our waitress showed up a few times, but definitely wasn't as much as we would like. Again it was busy, so I can give them a pass this time.

So happy we discovered Beer Park. It's totally right up our alley - great craft beer selection, great food, awesome view, dope music, and family friendly! Located right in front of the Paris Hotel, with an amazing view of the strip and the Bellagio Fountains. Our kiddo enjoyed the games provided and the Bruno Mars/JT playlist, he sure loves to dance! It was about 95 degrees out that evening but the misters, fans and ice cold beers made it feel very pleasant up there. Beers were on the pricey side but that's to be expected of the location. No complaints there. We ordered the Loaded Tots, although it could have been more ""loaded"". I had to ask for an extra side of beer cheese and bacon. That was probably the only negative of the night but the service, delicious cold brews and great vibes made up for it. We also ordered the crinkle cut fries for our tot and he was all about them. Good fries + lots of games = happy kid. Happy kid = HAPPY MOMMA AND DADDY! =)

When we arrived for our reservation, the hostess initially told us that children weren't allowed that night because there would be a DJ playing that evening and the cut-off time was 8pm. Any other time would have been fine. I totally understood, and kindly just said I had wished we were informed that when I made the reservation. Before walking away, the hostess tells me, ""You know what, hold on. Let me talk to my manager and see what we could do."" A few moments later she returns and tells us the manager said it would be fine to bring in my tot, as long as we could be done by 11pm. Perfect! We were done around 10:30pm. I was so appreciative that she took the time to ask her manager, rather than just sending us away. Now that's great customer service. I can't remember her name...Kailani perhaps?.. but a big thank you to her. She was such a friendly hostess. The service for the rest of the evening was superb as well.

Dr. Campana is very detailed. I'm never sure which choice is clearer, but he made me feel very confident that I was getting the right prescription. After doing the ""1 or 2 better"" exam, he double-checked with lenses that I can walk around the store with to make sure that my eyes feel comfortable. Then when we did the contact lens exam. He put lenses over my contacts to see if I need more or less prescription. Other places stop at the ""1 or 2 better"" and then I pick up my prescription and it feels too strong or I'm dizzy. FAIL.

Tucked under the Panorama towers on Dean Martin it is a nice spot for the residence. But everyone and their mom can enjoy it as well. They have a deli grab and go side and a sit down dinning area with a pretty awesome bar. 

I went all because of their Pork Belly Nuggets a Delicouse crispy fatty nugget appetizer soaked in a Thai sweet chili sauce with peanuts and just the right amount of cilantro. I think the cilantro makes the whole thing so I hope you all like it but if not that's ok because this would be yummy with or without it. The Meaty Wrap breakfast burrito ok not amazing but really good. It have eggs, cheese, ham, bacon and house made sausage I think or of not it was gourmet sausage not no store bought Jimmy Dean (although I love me some Jimmy Dean) I thought that the gourmet one was a nice touch. The side of fried potatoes was amazing crispy, nicely season and cooked to perfection, not to mention they topped them with a little bit of sautéed onions which I loved! The salsa that came with the wrap was spicy to the right level and was just chunky enough.

I got a free Green Revolution smoothie with my Check in and my daughter loves it. It was the right blend of Kale, spinach, banana, pineapple, green apple and yogurt. Retail for $7 that was an awesome checkin! 

I love the styling and decor of the Resturant Chic, comfy and casual upscale (if that makes sense) I am dying to try their other menu item so I will definitely be back!

Well, I could tell you about the excellent selection of whiskey (one of the best in Vegas).  We could discuss the delicious menu with classic pub fare and inventive food twists.

They could boast about the crowd of Irishmen who come to watch soccer matches, rugby games and Celtic sports on early Sunday mornings.  He (the singer of one of the Irish music bands that play there) could tell you about the raucous music nights and great sounds of an Irish fiddle that drift about the bar on many nights.

Or I could simply say this: McMullen's is virtually hidden from the public view.  Directions to the business usually involve referring to landmarks rather than addresses: ""You go over to the Orleans and turn north, then go behind a gas station and it's right there"".  It is mostly obscured from the street, but that doesn't matter.  

The pub is so well put together--from the wood on the bar to the stones in the walls to the perfect pour of Guinness--that it remains a popular Vegas bar for folks to get a drink.

I wanted warm brown to reddish tones, and even color from top to bottom. The color result was dark black/ash, the complete opposite.  The cut was off scale, and Crystal seemed to be struggling in styling my hair.  I Paid $165.00. Plus a tip... I wanted my hari parted to the right.  Towards the front, I wanted volume and some lift.  None was achived...  I left the salon with black ash color, flat hair, and still wet in the back.

She spent under ten minutes styling my hair, for $165, I think it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect at least 20 minutes.  I went home, washed my hair,  and styled it myself... Lots of volume and bonus.  Keep in mind my hair is naturally curly.  I had better hair cuts when I only paid $15, for a tirm.  Very dissappointed!  Please, if you want to go this salon, make sure a friend or somone you know recommends a stylist.

I have never watched Ghost Adventures and I didn't know who Zak Bagans was before this, but I went with some family members because even though I don't believe in ghosts, the museum sounded like it would be really interesting and a lot of fun to see. I got through the first few rooms of the tour without incident, but after that I was hit with very intense feelings of dizziness in about half the rooms. Even though I was taking deep breaths, I felt like my body was not getting any oxygen. In one room this got so bad that I broke out into a heavy sweat and my ears started ringing so loud that I could barely hear, and it sounded like our tour guide was speaking from the next room into a tin can, even though he was only feet away from me. I was extremely embarrassed by this and struggled to not let anyone know I was having a problem, because I was afraid they'd think I was reacting to spirits and that I was being silly or overimaginative, and I didn't think anything like that was happening at all. I assumed I was simply claustrophobic (even though I am not claustrophobic at all) or overheated because some of the rooms were very small and there were a lot of us crammed into small spaces at times. It didn't even occur to me that I might be experiencing anything other than that, until I came home and read some reviews of people having similar feelings in some of the same rooms I struggled with the most. That gave me pause, and is causing me to do some further research on this. I also had a different but very intense reaction to one room in particular but I won't specify what I felt or what room it happened in, because I don't want to influence anyone or cause them to look for things that they might not notice otherwise. I want them to  come to their own conclusion. At time when I was struggling the most, I tried to slip away from the group and get into the hallways for some air. At least three times, I noticed Zak Bagans standing in the shadows further down the hallways, watching me intently, and I wondered if he could tell something was wrong. He never approached me, but he was often present. 

I highly recommend this tour, ESPECIALLY if you are a skeptic, and see if anything changes your mind or makes you start to wonder. My only complaint and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish there was a way they could set aside certain times where you could explore the museum at your leisure and without a guide. There were so many things to see, and it was impossible to really take everything in when you're crammed into a tiny room with 12 other people and a tour guide who is trying to keep your group ahead of the one directly behind you. I wish I could go back and explore the museum more slowly, with less people crowded around me, and see if I experience some of the things that happened during this tour. 

A funny note- I saw people complaining about fog machines. Those reviews were dated 11/3. I never saw any fog, and neither did the people I was with.

On my first visit, my friend and I decided to indulge in the happy hour special and we ordered the flat iron steaks. He ordered his with $3.50 extra house rub, I ordered mine plain. We also paid for two alacarte sides that we decided to split. When the steaks were placed in front of us, we weren't sure which had the rub and which didn't. We later found out that neither had the rub, but those were some damn good steaks. So good that we considered ordering second steaks. The flat iron was juicy, flavorful, and tender. I wanted to slap someone they were so good. We went around bragging about how wonderful the steaks were, and they were. At the time we thought, since we were charged for it, that both of our steaks got the house rub. 

Fast forward to the next trip where we brought some friends along, we decided almost recreate our first trip. We got 3 Kansas City cuts 2 with the rub and one with blue cheese. Lets just say this is when we discovered that we paid for a rub that we didn't get and we also paid for sides that should've come with the meal. I had to verify, since the first server charged us separately for the sides whether or not a side was included with a steak order. That rub that we didn't receive the first go round was definitely not the be's knees.  A couple sitting in the both next us thought the same thing. Finally, my friend who got the blue cheese topping on his steak really wanted more steak than blue cheese. Blue cheese is pungent enough that the entire 12oz piece of steak did not need to be covered in it. I took a bite of his steak and tasted no steak at all, just blue cheese. 

My advice, get the flat iron with no extra anything.",8/15/2013 1:08,36.1226036,-115.1710908,3377 S Las Vegas Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Food, Coffee & Tea",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Teavana

I felt a little dumb but whatever, I mentioned how another girl who worked there the last time I was there advised I use the ion brand, and she obviously gave good advice as I am happy with the outcome. She ROLLED HER EYES, and assured me that wella brand was the only toners in the shop.

I decided to just stick with what I know, though I almost didn't want to purchase anything anymore to save her from becoming even more annoyed by myself. I decided I wasn't going to let this lady stop me, so I took the items to the counter. 'You need a developer with this.' Great. '30 Volume.' I go and quickly find it myself, and after she rang it up, I remember I had a hole half bottle left under my bathroom sink! Duh. Then again, 'Great. So sorry but can you take the developer off? I literally just remembered I have a huge bottle at home!' I felt like an idiot and she had already made me feel uncomfortable. She let out one of those big 'I'm so annoyed with you' sighs again, but the transaction was almost over. I finally paid and apologized a dozen times for my troubles and she insisted it was fine and gave an unenthusiastic 'have a nice day'. The end. I gave it a 3 star because the girl who helped me the last time was great, and the location is pretty awesome, I can do all my shopping in one go.

We placed a to go order and when we got home the fried lasagna appetizer was dried, semi burnt, and had no sauce. My husband called to speak with the manager and Jennifer placed him on hold for 10 minutes. He hung up and tried calling back. Each time, he would get hung up on. Ironically, when he used my phone to call for the 3rd time, he wasn't hung up on. Clearly being upset, when Jennifer answered the call again, my husband said he was on hold for 10 minutes before waiting to speak with the manager and that she had 1 minute to get the manager on the phone before...which she promptly interrupted him and said ""Before what?"" He then replied before escalating it to corporate. When the manager got on, he said he had no idea my husband was on hold for him the first time. Although the manager, Ron, was friendly and helpful, Jennifer left such a horrible impression with us that we will NEVER eat there again.

s_sfrmayWvqgSfkasLrylg,#NAME?,AtrjNTO33rv2IHPCigJ-0g,2,1,0,1,"I have lived here since February of 2014. Initially, the property was under Picerne, before turning over into NALS. The Picerne office staff was amazing. Helpful, friendly and always welcoming. Since the turn, it has been nothing but a hassle from these people. I have received several notices on my door, threatening $100 fines if I did not completely clear out my patio. I happen to keep a few of my daughter's small toys up there, as well as her bike. Because....where else do you put a child's bike? Interestingly enough, I have received these notices, yet I live on the second floor? So I am assuming they have people walk up and look through the little gap in the balcony? If you have to get that close to notice a child's bike, is it really worth a fine? Curious if the folks who live on the ground floor with fake plants and towels hanging off the sides of their balcony are receiving these notices?

The office staff, my gosh, where do I begin? They are not accommodating at ALL. I never get the feeling that I am welcome in there. It's a  ""pay us your rent and shut up"" sort of vibe. Camilla I believe was her name, who I haven't seen in a while may have been the most smug, arrogant individual to ever work in a leasing office. I thought maybe she had an issue with me, specifically but I was wrong as a co-worker had advised me that when she visited the property to inquire about renting, Camilla turned her completely off. As I stated above, I haven't seen her in a while so maybe she's been relieved of her duties.

The main manager, I believe, is Roxanne? Roxanne is a manager in some capacity. Anyhow, she also isn't nearly as friendly as you would think someone in that position would be. Was customer service experience a requirement to land employment in this place? Surely it wasn't because she sets the tone for the rest of her employees obviously. Rude, arrogant and all about collecting your money.

My apartment is amazing. I love it. Very spacious and open layout. I have never had any issues with thefts, unruly neighbors, noise, any of that. So from THAT standpoint I have no complaints. 

However, the difference between the two management companies is like night to day, winter to summer. I am strongly considering my options in terms of breaking my lease. I definitely will not be re-signing. I encourage you to look elsewhere before stopping here. Look up Picerne properties as they seem to be better equipped at dealing with residents.

I had been at this restaurant when it was Isabella's under different ownership.  It was good coming back because it is a such a lovely restaurant, and looking out over the lake during dinner makes dinner a bit more enjoyable.

For Restaurant Week, there was a choice of appetizers.  I chose the potato leek soup.  There was no choice for the main course--it was surf and turf--a T-bone steak with two shrimp.  The choices for dessert were blueberry banana Foster cheesecake or baked ""Hawaiian"" pineapple.  I chose the blueberry cheesecake.

I was brought the iced tea I ordered and a server brought me a dish with two squares of focaccia.  The focaccia was a bit dry from sitting out for too long a time.  I was also brought a tasty amuse-bouche of crab with a piece of avocado.

The soup came with a jalapeño bacon ragout in the bowl and the server poured the soup over the ragout.  There were pieces of fingerling potatoes in the soup but no discernible pieces of leeks although there was a leek flavor to the broth.  

After a perfect amount of time, the main course was brought.  The steak was done the way I requested.  It was topped with a brown sauce and mushrooms and some cooked cherry tomatoes.  The steak was on a bed of mashed potatoes.  I generally don't get a sauce when I order steak, but this fit the bill and went with the dish well.  The brown sauce was rich.

After another perfect wait of time, my dessert was brought.  It was listed as a blueberry banana Foster cheesecake and it consisted of blueberry cheesecake topped with a brûléed banana with candied pecans and Chantilly cream.

Service was very good.  There was a mixup in the beginning when a server brought me a salad instead of the soup I ordered.  That was immediately remedied.  My iced tea was topped off two times during dinner and I was asked if I wanted more after I had paid the bill.

I'll be coming back when the weather is cooler and I'll get a seat outside and enjoy the lakeside dining.",6/22/2019 23:05,36.1436335,-115.2764657,8471 W Sahara Ave,NV,Las Vegas,89117,"Restaurants, Mexican",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Del Taco

Despite having 2 registers at the to-go counter, I was directed to the salad bar with a diminuitive smile and told 'There aren't actually any registers here'. She probably meant that they weren't on, sooo whatever. Not a huge deal but worth mentioning.

I got the muffaletta sandwich with salami for the boy. It was on thick, flavorful bread with cheese, olives, hearty portions of salami and what tasted like pepperoncini. It came with a bag of chips and a cup of soup [I opted for the tortilla] for about $8-9 after tax. The soup was really tasty, made with beef and full of rich umami flavor and vegetables. I saw tomatoes, carrots, corn and lots of herbs. 

The sandwich was a generous portion and I like that it came with two sides. I find this comparable to Quizno's 2 items for $6. I'd say this restaurant is much higher quality, though. For a dollar or two more you can get an organic salad topped with a delicious array of toppings. I would like to go in sometime for their salad bar, it looked quite promising from what I could see. My veggie-lovin' self could have an orgy of produce on my plate and be stoked! It looks like a lot of it is organic, too, which is a great thing to see in the middle of the desert.

It was fine; we each got an udon bowl that was decent: one order of the udon with thin sliced ribeye (fat noodles) and one with tempura (medium noodles). Noodles and broth were ok, but they forgot to put in the order of kara-age (there were 2 tables to service, so i dont see a reasonable excuse), and then they overcharged me a dollar for my dish, AND they used whiteout on the bill to change it to the incorrect price. The guy was gracious enough when I pointed it out, but I just left with a (figurative) bad taste in my mouth.

anyway, we sat at a booth towards the back of the restaurant. our server was nice and friendly, she checked on us frequently even though it was obvious that she was running around servicing multiple large groups. i ordered the andy's sage fried chicken salad while others in my party had the popular dishes, chicken and waffles, pancakes, fried chicken eggs benedict.  my salad, just like all of their dishes, was ginormous! a house bowl of salad with caramlized pecans, apple slices, two pieces of the fried chicken and the big ol' biscuit. i asked for the mango dressing on the side. i have had the sage fried chicken at other locations and this time, my chicken was completely BLAND. what happened???? i was soooo disappointed :(

To our delight we passed this place on the way home.  We used to LOVE eating at OTB back in CO.  But alas, this was no where near what we were used to.  We were seated right away, but the place wasn't busy.  Our waiter seemed to have great potential but that was just an illusion.  I got my food and it was wrong.  Waiter took it back immediately and brought it back out in about 10 min.  So, I sat there eating chips while the rest (5) of my party ate their dinner.  Yay!  Finally my meal is here.  But wait.  What is this?  It's wrong, yet again.  It's just enchiladas...how can you get these wrong...twice?  I didn't feel like messing with it so I ate it...with no enjoyment.  The food was horrible and bland.  This is not what I remembered from CO.  

Well, as we suck down our beverages the waiter HEISTS my brother's empty root beer glass for a refill.  Yes, he took it to refill it and NEVER brought it back until 20 min when something was said.  Then my husband and I wait for water refills which never came until we asked for it.  And my poor niece, wanting a strawberry lemonade...never got it...but we were charged for it.  Of course, the hubby made sure the $1.59 lemonade was removed.

We were all speechless.  Normally, we would've spoken to a manager but it was decided that we will NEVER come back to this place.  So, it wasn't worth the effort.

We had the crab fried rice, panang curry chicken, rad nar with beef and the sweet sticky rice with lychee. The crab rice was very good, not overly greasy, not mind blowing but very nice on the palate. The rad nar was like an Asian version of an American beef stew but not as rich and heavy. It was warming on a cold winter night and the thick flat noodles were a delightful change of pace.  The panang curry chicken was loaded with flavor and I love the fact that they use white meat chicken which was very tender and cooked just right... they serve a bowl of white rice on the side which is great for absorbing all the delicious panang sauce, personally I think they need to make the side of rice a little larger. Finally, for dessert we had the sticky rice with lychee, it was served warm and had a mildly sweet flavor.  The lychee fruit added a nice touch with its combination of sweet and tart... we all agreed that we prefer the sticky rice with mango at Archie's best!

Upstairs There are three small  seating areas, but only small group was there.

The little bar was crowded with happy people and the bartender was great- wonderful smile, nice personality. 

I didn't find the leather club chairs to be especially comfortable and would have preferred a real table, but overall, it wasn't a bad experience. There were two nice flatscreen TVs showing basketball, which the bar group enjoyed loudly. I loved how the natural light looked, streaming in through the windows and hitting the brick walls. Ah, Ohio...

The food? Meh.  When you serve cheese sauce with beer in it, the beer does not make up for using VELVEETA. Ok? REAL cheese, please. The chips weren't that good either. I was so disappointed. I tried the garlic pretzels and they were good, but more like soft, kosher-salted rolls. My friend's steamed clams did not taste fresh to her, but she thought they were ok.

What we liked:
-- they have an old fashioned one-armed bandit that releases quarters when you win. (I didn't see that elsewhere.)
-- frequent low pay-outs at the slots.  (I'm no gambler.  I don't expect to make money.  I get excited winning even a couple of cents!)
-- decent drinks
-- they have a room, which probably nobody visits, with old articles, menus and such from the casino's early days.  Oh, and an old safe!

My nail tech : Dee. 

The bad: 

Nail shaping - was off. 

All I had done was re-polish gel on my hands, no manicure - so she charged me $20 for gel, $5 for ""take down"" - most places won't charge you for a repolish on gel. That was disappointing. 

She started with my hands, but at anywhere else I've ever gone - you start with the toes first for regular polish since they take longer to dry - THEN do hands for gel. I thought it was standard practice. And since I didn't have time to wait for my toes to dry I opted not to get them done. 

I prefer, and think it's healthier, for your nails to be wrapped or soak off the gel on your nails, she wrapped my nails but waited maybe two minutes before she began scrapping off the gel - she'd scrape a little then re-wrap, it was really annoying and if I hadn't said something she might have torn one of my nails off. 

The shop was just too quiet - no TV's, no music, just sound from outside. 

The good:

If you're looking for a fancy design, I think this place does really nice work. Custom and more difficult art. - I like the plain stuff tho.

Since it was Thursday, I wasn't sure if I could get in at the last minute, but they were able to get me in for both a facial and a haircut on the same day.

When scheduling, they asked me about my hair in order to better pair me with a stylist.  I have super fine hair, so I was excited to be paired with somebody who is good with hair like mine.

I was staying on Fremont and was worried about being late, so I took a cab.  I'm really glad I did because if I had followed the map on my iphone, I would have gone to the wrong place.  They have the address listed right, but for some reason when the map came up it put the ending point north as opposed to south.  I was worried when the cab went in the opposite direction of the star on the map.  I started to secretly panic, but he assured me that if we turned around, we would be going the wrong way.  Once we got there I realized that it would be an easy walk along 4th St, so that is how I walked back.

First was the facial.  I lost count of how many masques and lotions they used, but they were all great.  It also included foot and hand/arm massages.  It was WONDERFUL. 

Immediately after, I had my haircut.  The shampoo was great.  The chair automatically reclined and had a massager built into the back.  It also involved a light scalp massage.  The hairdresser really knew what she was doing and gave me a great cut and style.  I'm glad I took her advice.  I am extremely happy, but then again, I am also the type of person who goes to a new salon for a haircut while on vacation.  I'm not exactly protective of my hair. :)

After reading criticism of it being too small, I paid attention, and I didn't feel like it was too small.  It is well laid out, very stylish, and is actually more spacious than the salon I go to at home.  One thing I really liked is that there are mirrors everywhere, so regardless of how the stylist turned my chair, I could always watch what she was doing.  It may not be great if you are prone to panic and overanalyze your stylist's every move...or maybe it is.

The total bill for both came to about $100 after the discount.  I feel like that is a fantastic deal.  It definitely took the discount to get me to try it out, but now that I've been, I will definitely come back on a future trip (even though I sadly won't get a discount).",11/9/2010 21:28,36.07577579,-115.191676,"6265 S Valley View Blvd, Ste J",NV,Las Vegas,89118,"Specialty Food, Food",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Michael's Gourmet Pantry

Luckily for me, my best friend is a local out there and she takes me to a ton of restaurants way off the Las Vegas Strip.  Made - LV is in a gorgeous, newly built shopping center quite a ways away from the strip.  It's a lovely restaurant, and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  That's a bonus!  

The dishes here are pretty small, which was great only because I got to try a bunch of different things.  We ordered the Bacon and Eggs, which consisted of one deviled egg (2 halves), some toast, and a really thick slice of yummy bacon.  Everything on the plate was good, it was just really small and hard to share between 5 people.  Next, we had the chicken liver, which also came with toast and pickles.  Most people don't like liver, but I LOVE it, so I had to try it.  It was well made, there were no harsh flavors, it was just creamy and perfect to spread on a nice piece of toast.  We also had the mac and cheese (nothing special), nachos (that was massive, but nothing special either), and bacon cheddar biscuits (ok, those were pretty good, and you could really taste the bacon baked in there).  I think that was all we ordered, since we were drinking beer.  They did have a nice selection of beers from local breweries.  I think that menu changes though, but I'd check it out.  

The food was decent, but I wasn't blown away by it.  I think the prices were a little on the high side, considering each of the dishes were pretty tiny.

Not wanting to charge it and short on cash, I decided to take an uncut sheet of $2 bills I had and cut them up. While it's not the norm and I could have gotten more for them elsewhere, figured wouldn't hurt and the $2 bills would be a nice novelty.

I ordered the items, they were delivered, paid for them with he $2 bills and gave a hearty tip.

I never received any calls or emails on the subject. All my calls are monitored, recorded and logged by a third party and will prove this.

Today, two uniformed officers, doing their job respectfully came to my door. It seems that I was the suspect in a fraudulent case. I asked in regards to what and they informed me that I had paid for pizza with fraudulent two dollar bills.

I then proceeded to show the officers the box they came in from the U.S. Treasury, the original packaging from them as well as other examples of uncut sheets of money as well as proof of purchase from the US Treasury directly, fortunately I saved the original box. They informed me that they had never seen uncut sheets of money.

I asked why the bills were not tested before hand as a test would have shown they were authenticate. I also explained that most banks would freely test the bills without question and confirm their legitimacy. As these bills were from the U.S. Treasury directly, I have little doubt that they are authenticate. In either case, certainly if I had the means to manufacture fraudulent notes, it would be more than $2 bills and the use of pizza at my home address.

In either case, how Dominos handled this was totally out of line. They could have verified the notes with their bank or frankly a $5 bank note pen. They could have also contacted me directly which documents would prove never did. The police did their job and I respect that but Dominos was out of line.

The waste of tax payer dollars, the waste of my time and the waste of officers times best used on real crimes is absurd.

Pick your size, pick your crust, pick your cheese/toppings/extras/whatever the hell you want on the pizza.

The pesto sauce is awesome, and you can split the pizza in half, if you prefer different sauces/combinations.

We went super late to Fiddlestix around 2am because we were already in the downtown area and my friend from out of town was hungry. 

We ordered nachos and was asked if we wanted to add steak to the nachos. We said yes...uhh weird, it came out with shredded chicken on top and we were charged for steak. And my boyfriend orders chicken tenders, that came out fine. Last me and another friend order the brownie sundae and an ice cream sandwich. The 2 food orders came out at a decent ticket time. However after 30 mins later I got up to ask where the desserts were. The guy Anthony (I'm assuming is him cause his name was on my receipt) that put our order in said it's on it's way. So I sat back down. 15 mins later from when I got up...the brownie sundae shows up. We ask again where the ice cream sandwich is? The Anthony guy again says it's coming right now. We then wait another 10 mins...I get up to ask the same guy..he points at the food window and says it's being done...I said if it's not done in the next 2 mins we don't want it anymore! 

He walks away from me and leaves me at the front for 10 more mins that someone behind me asked if we ordered yet...I said yes! But haven't gotten our ice cream sandwich for an hour now! He was just as shocked as we were that it was taking sooo long! And at 3am there wasn't much people in there! So what was taking them so long. 

The Anthony guy comes back and I said we're not waiting anymore! I want a refund!! He points at the window again and said it's coming now...I said you keep saying that! I want a refund! He continues to ask me for my receipt I give it to him and he just gives me the $6 back! But yet you charged me tax on our order...do I not get that back?! He had an excuse for that too! 

My boyfriend is a executive chef at a near by restaurant and one of my friends is a GM for a restaurant for years! So they wondered why the ticket time was over an hour for an ice cream sandwich when there were 2 cooks expediting the food!! And there were only us 4 left in the restaurant. Just ridiculous! We will never be back!! And Anthony please start being straight forward with people instead of lying and BSing us for an hour! We most likely would have been more cool about it...but the fact that you continued to keep BSing us..it was pissing us off.

However, there was a major change in my viewpoint  as there was a huge shift in stars. This place is no good as a casino and has zero Vegas Old School Gambling coolness; however as a hang out, it ROCKS! I have been hitting this place as a newly single guy and I love it here. The place is nuts in the bars and clubs so I am a fan now. 

Champagne Bar is really slick and is a big time meet and greet for singles place. Its the biggest bar in the place outside, of the clubs but very cool and broken up into different areas for chilling with friends or a date. Its not too meat marketish that women fear going in alone, but more fun and a great place to hang.

The other bars scattered around the casino are also great places to just chill and have a drink. Meeting people from everywhere and the young hipsters are more than interesting to watch. I seriously enjoy just sitting at the bar meeting and greeting people coming and going.

As for the shops and such, its top notch. Stitch is really slick and the owners there are very cool. its not for the faint of heart suit pretty much starts at $1,500 but its really a cool place to check out. 

So.. I stand corrected sort of.. the casino is still not Vegas, but the singles action is top notch!

Most of my Yelp buds gave Burger Bar good ratings, so I knew a meat feast was inevitable.   Shawn H. put out a UYE for Burger Bar and I took advantage of this opportunity. Keep in mind that Burger Bar is located inside Mandalay Bay.  Most restaurants tend to cost a little more in a casino on the strip.  But at Burger Bar, prices are fairly cheap considering its location.  Burger Bar has a huge selection and you can also create your own burger.  These are all great call outs for a burger joint. But first things first, I need to point out is that this visit was during Lent in which red meat is currently being sidelined. Second, I don't drink much.  So, my review might not be a fair one at the moment because I am not reviewing Burger Bar for what they are known for, which is a burger and a bar.  

This visit and rating is for their service and their Salmon Burger. The Salmon Burger is huge at a half pound and prepared medium well. Price is about $10 which is a good start. However, I felt that taste was lacking and the salmon patty was dry. I know salmon isn't flavorful in the first place, but I have had tasty salmon burgers at other restaurants (ie. Halphen Red in San Diego).  Since I was eating 8 oz of this stuff, I at least got about 40 grams of protein and Omega 3's.  In all, I was disappointed with my salmon burger. 

The service is pretty good considering that our party was fairly big.  Burger Bar is very accommodating and the staff is excellent.  You can say that the service almost cancelled out the poor taste of the salmon burger.  I have not given up on Burger Bar. I still have their real burgers to try and based on what other Yelpers have stated already, this is what they are known for. 

PS:  This was a Shawn H's UYE.  I had a great time with other Yelp friends.

We gave our name and waited an hour for our table, only to find, after paying close attention, that people who came in after us were being seated before us. They gave our table, for Joe, to someone else, named Joey.  The hostess, literally conversed with us during that wait.  I told her I had trouble hearing and she said she would come get us.  Aside from being careless, she couldn't see we were standing around much longer than everyone else?  It was completely unacceptable.  Being as hungry as I was, I let them seat us anyway rather than throwing a verbal fit in public.  They sat us next to Joey, the guy who they gave our table to.  Scott, the waiter, was actually a nice guy. Even he was not enough to pull this rating above a one-star.  The food was okay.  I've had better at In-N-Out.  Totally overpriced hamburgers.

They were recommended by our Pediatrician. I called every week for a month, then every day for another 6 weeks. But, I have to say it has been worth it. I would have called every hour knowing what I know now. The front office staff is friendly and upbeat every time we come in. They answer all my questions and when I have needed to let them know we can't come they have always explained all the details to me. If I am confused about our schedule, they offer to print it out and they call whenever they have a time slot that is on my preference list. I have never had one bad interaction and I see them 5 times a week now. In fact, I am quite friendly with many of them. 

Now to the therapists. For speech, we see Ms. Steffany who is sweet and supportive and incredible with my daughter. You can tell she really forms relationships with the kids. We see Ms. Jamey who is bright and energetic and firm with my kid. We see Ms. Kay who is positive and encouraging and kind with her. They all give me little reports after each session. They all have their strategies. They all are helping my girl improve and progress and I am thrilled with the results week to week. They all answer my questions and provide advice for stuff I can do at home. We now see Ms. Ariana for Aquatic OT. She is patient and is taking the time to learn about what my kid needs help with. We just started with her and I can already see how she's coming up with ideas for their time. We will start with Ms. Audrey soon for OT. 

My kid said her first word at MLF in just her 2nd week. She's said something to many things every session every week and now, at 9 months of sessions she's singing and repeating and improving every day at home. She runs into the MLF office and comes out smiling every session. I couldn't be happier with the work being done there and I know that I will never find a way to thank them. They do have very specific rules regarding absences and lateness and no shows, but I have had zero trouble in this arena. I just call in the amount of time required. Plus, unlike any other office I have ever worked with, they offer you something if they have to cancel with little notice on their end! I'm happy. My little girl is getting amazing help. She's proud of herself. And, I have entirely pleasant and professional interactions with everyone who works there.",7/25/2018 19:25,36.109945,-115.170841,"3663 S Las Vegas Blvd, Ste 505",NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Asian Fusion, Japanese, Restaurants, Hawaiian",Restaurants,,1,Restaurants_Food,,,,Restaurants_Food,Poukei

I hate attending gyms where everyone is weak. There's no motivation in an environment like that. Also, there are so many hot girls here. That's a huge motivational advantage as well. When you workout next to hot chicks, you'll want to be at your best. Bottom line, it'll get crowded and you'll more than likely have to walk a distance to get to the front door.
