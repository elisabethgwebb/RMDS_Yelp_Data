""tickled to death"" would have been the best description.  A  lot of that had to do with one of their employees who was the hardest worker I've ever seend.

This move was flawless.  I had to do it at a reasonable price so I packed and moved all the boxes in advance.  I told the two guys who showed up that money is tight and asked that they get the big stuff loaded and stop at a certain time.  They were very aware and checked in with me several times on ""want to move?"" ""want to leave this here?""  The bottom line is they got all the big stuff and had time to go back and pack and load some of the smaller straggler items and stayed within timeline.  At the new house they moved just as fast and watched the clock for me.

They were clean, polite and respectful.  No damage. No hassle. My only regret if I didn't have more cash to an impressive level for a job well done.",11/5/2014 2:35,36.2197281,-115.1277255,1015 Sharp Cir,NV,North Las Vegas,89030,"Hardware Stores, Home Services, Building Supplies, Home & Garden, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Nevada House of Hose

I was surprised by how small the restaurant was inside.  There's more seating in the hallway that leads to the rear tower of the Tropicana Hotel.  I decided to eat inside because there had been a whole lot of people rolling suitcases down that hall and I wanted a little more quiet. The restaurant inside is almost all white.

The bread basket was brought quickly.  A couple of things here.  The bread was very dry, stale even, and the mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar is just the wrong shape for this dipping sauce.  There's way too much olive oil and the balsamic just sits at the bottom.  The basket had a piece of lavash, some focaccia, a roll, and a slated bread stick.  The star of that basket was the salted bread stick.

For a main course, I got the linguini with Manilla clams in a white wine sauce.  There were 10 clams arranged around the pasta.  This was excellent.  I wanted to drink the sauce left, but I used some of the bread to soak up the white wine sauce and I finished it that way.  For those who don't like salty foods, I could taste a fair amount of salt in the sauce.  I love salt so this was a good thing.  Others need to be warned about that.

For dessert, I got the tiramisu.  This was a very large piece of tiramisu different from what I've generally had, but it was very tasty.  On top was a lot of cocoa powder which set off the sweetness beneath.

The prix fixe menu gives you coffee or tea and a glass of house wine.  I got iced tea and instead of wine, I had a cup of coffee with dessert.  At most places, that would cause fits and an extra charge.  Here it was just fine!

I was going to give Bacio 3.5 stars, but shortly after I was seated, Chef Pellegrino had a meltdown with one of her staff--enough so that most people in the restaurant looked where she was and watched and listened.  She was giving grief to one of her bus people for wasting bread.  The meltdown ended with her saying, ""That costs money.""  She walked out of the restaurant for a few moments and then came back.  The show was worth an extra 1/2 star.  Brava!  The service by all the staff was superb!

I do have one complaint.  The French term for your kind of menu, Chef Pellegrino, is Prix fixe as you well know.  Please don't be lazy and spell it prefix like many people do who have no clue as to the origin of the term.  I know it sounds like prefix but don't succumb to dumbing down your own menu because people don't know.

Chef Pellegrino is very talented.  She was working in the kitchen all the time I was there.  Obviously she cares.  I am sure I'll make a return visit!",5/29/2012 15:45,36.1988346,-115.2064695,"2187 N Decatur, Ste 100",NV,Las Vegas,89108,"Thrift Stores, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Jover Art

The first time they told me I need a alignment.  After they did the alignment I looked at the results there was no need and I showed the manager and all he said was ""oh it wasn't that bad"". 

The second time I went with a different car they said I need new brakes and tires.  The brakes had just recently been changed and the tires although worn did not have to be replaced immediately as he made it seem.  

The third time was worst.  It was a different manager this time.  I went for a routine oil change he told me to come out and look at my car.   He showed me some things he recommended I get replaced under the hood.  I told him I did not want to take of that now and I just wanted the free oil change.  He then told me he would not do the oil change because if he did and did not fix the rest of the car he would be breaking the DOT laws and would have to have me tow the car off their property.  Sounded like a bunch of garbage to me so I called their other store on craig street and asked the person on the phone if they have ever heard of such a thing.  He said that sounded ridiculous. 

I ended up taking my car to their boulder hwy location no hassle all I did was dropped off my car and keys came back when they called me and that was it.  

The first thing the pecos shop asks is if you have their sticker card and if you do they start racking up all these other damages on your car.

We were meeting up with our friends at Marquee in the evening and were on a quest for a nearby casual place to have dinner.  I'm such a sucker for burgers and puns, so when we stumbled upon this place, I was sold.

The cheddar popcorn they have on the tables (for you to munch on as you peruse the menu) was so addicting!  Do they sell this stuff by the bag??  It's got the crispy texture (like normal popcorn and not the fluffy pirates booty kind).

I was still stuffed from the buffet lunch so I sadly had to opt for the greener pastures salad =(.  I was really bummed out about this since I LOVE my beef.  Boy would I regret it even more later. They were quite stingy on the avocado, but since it was Vegas and also not California, I let that one slide. Not to imply that the salad was bad!  It was actually VERY fresh, and organic too!

My fianc√© got the bullgogi burger and it was AMAZING.  It was perfectly seasoned and tasted EXACTLY how it should (the kimchi flavor really came through -- pretty surprising for an American burger joint!) The fried egg was still runny too =)  I actually ended up stealing 4 bites of it from him muhahaha.  We really loved the fact that the sauce wasn't overpowering everything, and that you can still enjoy all the flavors in the burger.  I'm definitely going to get my own next time haha.

Service was superb (also gave great burger and beer recommendations) and prompt.

I contacted several of the top-rated yelp landscapers and it was a nightmare.

The receptionist is so friendly and responsive. She always calls the day before an appointment with a reminder. She forwards my messages to the owner so I'm never ignored. The owner himself (Chris) came out for the landscaping consult. We talked in-depth about what I wanted and did not want. A few days later, I went out to their landscaped property to walk around and look at different options for my yard. Chris spent about half an hour with me making suggestions and explaining the life-cycles of different trees and plants that I was interested in (he's a very nice, knowledgable guy). His quote was extremely reasonable, and the landscaping was done quickly. It looks beautiful!

After the install, Chris walked me through the sprinkler system process step-by-step. He also provided me a packet that included all my plants, their location in the yard, and how to take care of them. The plants are warrantied, so I don't have to worry about cost if they don't survive the initial planting.

We always get the same special every time we go, so I can really only comment on the pizza and chicken fingers - which are so yummy!! The chicken fingers are nicely crunchy and saucy, and that ranch is soooo good and garlicky!! The pizza is a thin but the end crust is crispy on the outside and pillowy soft inside - ugh, so delicious!!! Now I've read some reviews, complaining that no one ""greets"" you and that their customer service is bad. I've been to MANY pizza shops that are set up just like this one is, it's pretty standard. There's a big sign as soon as you walk in the door that says ""Order Here"" so that's what you do! Usually we walk in, I go find a table and my husband orders - it's no biggie! And the customer service has always been great, we've never had a problem! I think sometimes you've just gotta be nice and people will be nice back - most customers expect over the top service when they themselves won't even say hello, please or thank you. I've said all three of these things every time I go and I get great service! And yes, it gets busy at mealtimes and for big sports events - it's a pizza joint!!

When I first entered the business they have sample shirts to try on if your not sure what type and size you are which is very helpful. I really do not like ordering clothes online that's why I think this is a great benefit. I was able to try on and order the polos with no problems. I was told to come back to verify the proof next week on Tues or Wed. 

Next week came along and no call so I called on Wed and they told me to come in Thur. I was ok with that so I arrived Thurs in the afternoon and it still hadn't been done. I had to wait about 15-20 min while it was being made so that was frustrating. They had all week and they didn't have the proof ready that takes 15-20 min. They redeemed themselves by getting the 5 polos embroidered the next day and when I came in that day I did not have to wait around.

I would say that the staff was very friendly. I dealt with Claudia. Hopefully next time it will be a better overall experience and I can give a better star rating.

And by the way the embroidered polos came out great but of course I have to see how they hold up so look for an update on this product.

I just want to reiterate that if need your item right away do not go to this business.

The hotel is right in the middle of everything which makes it easy to walk to where you want to go. The hotel itself is very clean and the staff was very helpful and kind. We had 1 studio and 2 regular rooms. The studio was like a mini suite, it was open concept with the beds and dining area all in the same room. The regular rooms were just as nice and clean. Both the studio and regular rooms had vanities and big mirrors so everyone had a space to get ready. The only gripe with the rooms were that they did not have a fridge, most hotels in Vegas come with a small fridge. We had to call for one, they charge you per day, which is ridiculous because again, this is normally standard. Luckily one of our guests was a diamond card holder of that hotel and we were able to get it for free. The hotel has the Toby Keith bar and grill which was fun. They also have 2 Starbucks locations and a big food court to choose from. The food in the food court was good, however 2 of my friends ate at the noodle bar and both got violently ill. I ate a veggie burger and parmesan fries with truffle oil, both very good.

I've been a few times already and everything is consistent considering I usually do the chicken platter or sandwich.  I've had the combination platter as well and it's probably the most common dish I've seen people order and consume.  My only issue is that the food becomes a bit bland after consuming multiple times but you can change it up with toppings including jalape√±os, onions and green peppers all chopped up.  The white sauce gives each dish a little more flavor but it reminds me more of a ranch/mayonnaise mixture.  The hot sauce is like fire in a bottle so make sure to just use drops until the right spice level is reached because just a little over your spice threshold and your mouth will be on fire for some time!

Ive come here about 2-3 times a month for the past 2yrs plus. Always do AYCE. The main thing that got me as a repeat customer is their service(at least in my experiences) is considerably better than most sushi places Ive visited. I counted and cant even believe Ive tried 12 different AYCE sushi spots in Vegas to date. Im not a big fan of the traditional sushi, more into the creative and many rolls that these places sell. I like to say Im more into the 'americanized' type of sushi and have been able to convince friends who dont even eat raw fish to try it with me and most liked it. So you can take what you want from my review based on that. This place does get very busy at dinner with sometimes long waits to be seated so I try to frequent at lunch. Service can take longer at times. I typically like to sit at the bar when I sushi. I have experienced faster service that way usually, so now I lean towards sitting at the bar. The ambiance, decor and music targets the more younger demographic.
Some items I favor are the seared salmon nigiri, cajun albacore nigiri, tiger roll, double screaming orgasm, heart attack, ian special, chung hua, kamikaze & surf n turf roll. At every AYCE I go for green tea ice cream and hamachi kama(not on AYCE here) if its available. They do also have brulees, mochi ice cream and parfaits for dessert. All desserts are limited to 1 per cept for ice cream. Dinner AYCE limits are 1 uni, 1 ama ebi and 2 raw oysters which is similar to most AYCEs. Theres a list of appetizers which I will order from ocassionally but I concentrate more on the sushi and green tea ice cream. :)
Is it the freshest and highest quality seafood? No. Its decent. It does say theres a time limit of, 90min I believe? Dont remember exactly atm since its never come into play. Ive never been rushed even tho I know I have passed the time limit before, or things like being reminded repeatedly on leftover charges. I realize this may not be everybodys cup of tea but for food and service Ive gotten here, I think you definitely get your moneys worth.",1/18/2013 13:44,36.1587857,-115.2388415,6651 W Charleston Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89146,"Christmas Trees, Home & Garden, Shopping, Tree Services, Home Services",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Deerbrooke Farm

First off, the food was delicious. We ordered a charbroiled pork bahn mi, and opted to make a custom bowl of pho with various meats. Both definitely hit the spot! I loved the smokiness of the pork with the pickled veggies in the sandwich. My boyfriend loved his pho as well, and gave his stamp of approval. The broth was flavorful, but not overpowering. 

Why the three stars? 

To sum it up, we were put off by the service. When we arrived, there was only one other table with people. As we ate, we felt that the servers could have been more attentive, as we weren't really checked on. However, what really turned us off was when a family of four came in and waited to be seated. They waited for roughly five minutes to be seated because there was no one manning the front of the house. I felt that that was not the best customer service. Other than that, I had no other concerns.

Everything was so good, it was actually overwhelming, and I don't think we spoke the entire time we were inhaling it all.

It has also been years since I've had an elote! I used to flag down the elote man like every damn day growing up in Los Angeles, so I was in heaven! 

Lastly, I asked for a bolillo bread roll by itself, as the menu lists it as a sandwich-type dish, and I expected the waitress to think I was a weirdo. But not only did she NOT think I was a weirdo, she totally validated my request and we both went on about how delicious they are with just a little bit of [vegan] butter and sugar with cinnamon. She happily brought some to my table. I love her. And her mother (who was in the back cooking up deliciousness) also commented on how good that sounded and that she wanted some too! I love her also.

Nothing I ate really made me think 'I HAVE to have this again'.

This was like eating in a library. Everyone was quite, they/we were afraid to talk because it was so pretentious. The classical music featured such hits as: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wod-MudLNPA&feature=related
Listen to this song and you can imagine the setting. 
I was seated on a purple velvet couch with pillows. After fidgeting with the pillows to prop myself up right at the table, well I noticed a foot stool, ""odd for such a fancy place"" I thought, but I had walked quite a way in 4 inch heels, so I used it.  I later found out this apparently is for you purse. (awkward)

First of all, the waiters seemed to hang on your every word, which was annoying. If I want to talk to my date, well i don't need anyone chiming in. I asked my date 'what do you think this means'? Referring to something on the menu, out of no where pops a waiter who answered just as he is about to answer. That's what i mean. The whole meal we had to whisper, we finally started texting each other. That's pretty bad.

If I smiled the head waiter would come over and ask if I needed something. I would say 'no I'm fine'. Pretty soon I just kept smiling to drive him crazy, it worked. He kept stopping at every pass. He probably now thinks I had the hots for him.

QUICK TIP: For those of you too embarrassed to ask: If you see a menu item that says (supp $40) after it, that means on top of the menu price they add $40 dollars to it for whatever reason, like the truffle cheese souffle. They said it was because of the amount and price of truffles used. The lamb, well I guess it was a baby lamb fed gold flakes and the milk of the gods .

Anyway on to the food: 
The amuse bouche (aka ""gift from the chef"") was a tin on a plaque. It looked like a tin of caviar, but it had something creamy under it. It was interesting. I ate it to be polite, but it was nothing special. In fact it was rather flavorless and the texture was off putting. It looked pretty.

Everything was plated beautifully.
The crab salad was my favorite menu item and my second course. It was excellent and almost too pretty too eat. The flavors and texture combined were amazing.

My dates cheese souffle was too rich for me. The date ate it and was ""not impressed"".  The expensive truffles really did not seem to add anything to the dish other than a presentation factor.

The main course I picked was lobster. It was beautiful, but a little tough. I expected it to melt like butter in my mouth. It didn't, in fact it was hard to cut. The flavor was ok, nothing special.

I tried my dates lamb, it was very good, it tasted like any other lamb I have had at a restaurant, which made me wonder again why the upgrade in cost.

The best part about the meal to me, was the bread cart. OH My God! It was pure heaven! They really need to open up a bakery for these clouds from heaven. They had the flakiest, butteriest, most flavorful, wonderful assortment of goodies, well i almost filled up on bread. 

You can have as many ""cart items"" from any cart, as your heart desires, don't be afraid to say ""one of everything"" when a cart comes strolling by. After 2 trips of the cart i pretty much did. There was garlic rosemary twists, brioche, cheese breads, croissants, crostini, baguettes, almost every type of bread imaginable and the absolute BEST!

The $20 martini or specialty drinks were delicious, worth $20 a pop? Not really. I did not taste or feel any alcohol. I think we should have gone for a nice bottle of wine.

Our actual desserts that came with the menu, they were odd. A strange menagerie of ingredients that I still am not sure if they went together well. I did not finish mine.

The dessert cart was pretty, none of the candies/treats were anything special. Coffee and water are extra$.

After the meal here ( $680 for 2), I wondered if rich people eat like this all the time, and if so, well I am glad I am not that rich or stuffy. I am, however, a food connoisseur. Someone who has always dreamed of eating at a 3 Michelin star rated restaurant, someone who would really appreciate the whole experience. I was somewhat disappointed, but I was truly happy for the experience.

Note: I talk about price a lot, but in actuality, $$ is no object for me.

We knew we would be unlikely to see any of the guys from the show and that we'd probably be waiting in line to get in.  The location is in downtown Las Vegas, near Fremont street, about a 12-15 minute drive from the strip.  We arrived around 1:30 p.m. and headed toward the front of the shop.  There was an area roped off for a line, but no line, and the door to the shop was open.  We weren't sure if we should, but headed inside.  We were greeted (and counted) by the door guy.  I was surprised we were just able to walk in!

The shop was busy but not crowded and we were able to easily make our way along the counters, looking at the items for sale.  As I should have guessed, it's not as large inside as it looks on tv.  We were allowed to take photos anywhere except the area facing the main cash registers.  We noticed several items from the show on display in a back cabinet with many things marked ""not for sale!""  There was also a gift shop area, and two cardboard cutouts of Rick, so you can take a pretend photo, lol!  I purchased a necklace from a jewelry line they were carrying as well as a slot machine charm to add to my charm bracelet.  Jeremy was very nice and helpful, and I didn't feel as if he minded showing us the items whether or not we purchased them.

As we checked out, I asked Jeremy if he had any tips/hints on seeing the guys.  He said they usually come out to greet fans once a day and are in the back part of the store the rest of the time.  He said they were there but had a really busy day so they were not coming into the main shop area.  However, Chumlee was DJing at a dayclub and Rick was going to be bartending at his restaurant/bar across the parking lot in the next couple days.  He gave us the card with the info as we left.

I cannot remember exactly how many types of different kinds of varieties of food they have here but they have a lot and if I ever felt over stuffed in my life this was the time I almost exploded.

I would never rate a buffet anywhere above three stars. But like I said this one is different because of all the varieties. There is a special chef in front of each buffet and by the looks of it everything is cooked fresh right off of the oven right in front of you. The food didn't just taste great but it was absolutely amazing and I had a little bit of everything from every buffet. I was extremely shocked how well made everything was. It's a little bit on the pricey side but it was well worth what I paid.

The location on the strip can't be beat. There is so much to see just in The Venetian and The Palazzo, but it was just a short walk from Mirage, Caesars and the Bellagio. We ate at a 2 of the restaurants in house and both were delicious, Tao and AquaKnox. The rooms were a great size, couches and beds both were comfy. I really partook in everything I could. Bubble bath (divine) Trip to the gym (huge and well equipped, although a little confused why we had to pay an additional fee to use it) lunches at Canyon Ranch (highly reccommend the spinach salad, 2 years later I still remember how yummy it was) My husband worked all day and schmoozed all night, but I assured him everything was top notch!


While we were there we went to see the Blue Man Group show. The ticket people were very helpful and even though it was kind of last minute they managed to hook us up with seats in the second row, we were so close I could see individual drips of paint!

We recently experienced the car periodically stalling at stop signs or red lights. We decided to bring it into the Jim Marsh Kia's service department for repairs the last week of October. 

Initially, we were told that the issue was under warranty and they'd repair it. Red flags went off in my head when we were presented with a nearly $400 bill. If the issue was under warranty, then what were we paying for? Regardless, we needed our second vehicle and had been paying for a rental car. 

After leaving the shop, my car stalled. They had closed for the day, but my husband notified the service manager the following day (Friday) and informed him that we'd be bringing the car back on Saturday. He suggested bringing it on Monday because no one would be able to look at it until then. The stalling had become more frequent and I was almost rear-ended several times (with my hazards on). 

This past Friday, we were asked to pay an additional $900 for repairs. I'm trying to understand what they ""repaired"" with my $400 to correct the stalling issue and why in the world are we going to give them any more money??? They were eager to say that we can just pick up our car and take it elsewhere. The thing is, Kia is the maker of the vehicle so if they are incapable of repairing it, then why would I go to a random mechanic? Just do the job that should have been done in October and don't ask me or my husband for another cent.",11/12/2018 11:58,36.261867,-115.247849,7035 W Ann Rd,NV,Las Vegas,89130,"Children's Clothing, Fashion, Toy Stores, Baby Gear & Furniture, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Childrens Orchard Rio Vista Plaza

The reason why I gave it only 3 stars is mainly because of their drinks.  They were bland and didn't have much flavor.

But even so, the waiters were prompt and attentive.  We didn't feel like they were hoovering over us making sure our coffee cups were full.  We got an outside table.  It was a clear, blue sky morning and warm.  Not many people walking the strip (probably sleeping in from the night before).  A couple runners here and there.  

Ordered:
- coffees
- croissant sandwich
- big skinny pancakes (I think it was a special of the day)
- homemade brioche

Coffee was great.  Smoother than Starbucks Blonde (as a comparison).  Croissant sandwich was good.  Nothing really special about it.  Skinny pancakes were great.  Never had them before.  With the whip cream and fruit, it was a light n sweet treat to compliment my black coffee.  Never had brioche, so I didn't know what to expect.  But at first sight, it looked like a french toast without the syrup or egg brush.  Just a thick toast basically with a side of butter.  In comparison, to everything we ordered, the brioche was the most bland (maybe that's what it's suppose to be).  Overall, I think the price of the food could be a bit cheaper.  Maybe knock of $2/item on the breakfast menu while keeping the same quality/portions would be fair.  If that were the case, I would compensate by tipping the waiter more.

This dining establishment is a hidden gem located within a busy plaza in Chinatown.  I had called weeks prior to the date of arrival trying to get a reservation.  Unfortunately, no one picked up my three phone call attempts on various days.  That was very disappointing.  

On Saturday night, the GF and I decided to come here in hopes of scoring a table without reservations.  We were greeted by the hostess, and she said we would be able to sit at the bar in about ten minutes.  Five minutes pass and we ask her if we would be able to get a table instead.  She says no, and that they are booked for the night.  Then, a couple minutes later, she tells us someone who made reservations did not show up!  

The menu is one page, front and back, with lots of options that will make your mouth water.  We decided on the infamous Rakus Tofu, juicy deep fried chicken, crispy asparagus okaki, corn potato, butter sauted scallop, foie gras don, soboro don, and the waygu beef sashimi.  

The tofu was no joke.  It was the freshest I have ever eaten.  The ingredients used to pair  with the tofu complimented each other perfectly.  Make sure to try the green tea salt because that is what the chef recommended first.  Out of all the dishes, the plating on this one was the most creative.  The asparagus came next, accompanied by the corn potato.   The asparagus coated in the tempura batter was mind blowing.  The outside was so crunchy, and was a pleasant surprise.  The corn potato was my favorite dish.  Never could a dish be so simple, yet so elegantly presented.  I do not know how they did it, but hats off to them.  

Next up was the waygu beef sashimi, buttered scallop, andthe fried chicken.  The waygu slices were ultra thin, and such top tier cuts.  I practically ate the whole thing, and still wanted more!  The scallop was served on its shell, and the light sauce drizzled on top was very good.  The scallop itself was a tad bit chewy, and there were two hard mystery pieces that needed to be spat out.  The juicy, fried chicken was very good.  Although I wished it had been more crispy, it was definitely juicy.  I would have enjoyed it more had there been no chewy tendons in some bites.  

The foie gras don and soboro don came out last.  The foie gras was everything one could hope for, and so much more.  The buttery duck was well worth the wait.  The sauce that went with it was so good.  The soboro don was just okay.  I could have done without the pickled mustard, and there was no sauce to go with the dish.  

Overall, I am definitely impressed by this place.

At a past Brazilian Buffett the pineapple was my favorite, this pineapple I wouldn't even eat. Everything was dried out and flavorless or had the wrong flavors. 

I was excited for dessert because they had Tiramisu which is one of my favorites. First bite in I was running to the bathroom with food poisoning. 

I've been to Brazilian buffets and this was not one of them.

jZusO8PrVVmSsCskC7Rkpg,5EOWkWaFhB0DvPJKisQYGQ,2E7UBxILboMhUnSxq4mebw,1,0,0,0,"I am sorry to say that but I felt it is a scam. I wish I knew it before. So that I would be aware. Parents, please, open your eyes widely, and find out by your self. I know that of course, all kids are so excited and adorable on the show.  Most parents are happy to see their kid on the stage. But If you really want your kids to  have confidence,  I think this is not the place for your kids. I felt this company doesn't really care about kids. I personally felt they care their own position tho. Before summer, they offer you a kid's stage show program. It costs $220.Do not expect that it is going to be like wow. If you just want to make kids busy and happy to see with a fancy costume on stage, It is an ok place. If you have extra money to spend, it is ok. Teachers are nice. What I didn't like was the teacher are telling the script to kids and kids have to repeat exactly what she says and it was on the show of the stage. It looks really funny to me. They look much better without it. But for sure so many parents don't care about it. Because they are into their kid's playing. Because the kids are so adorable. I understand. I may have a different point of view. I felt kind of sad. Because my kid and also some other kids can remember the most script. But on the show, the teacher makes him say the same sentence twice during the show. That wasn't nice of her. It is like one kind of punishment. He didn't like it at all but felt been embarrassed. Why should he say the same sentence twice on the stage??? It doesn't make sense to my kid. Also, most of the kids were confused from different timing or position they should to stay than they were ordered by the different teacher or different script from the different teacher that took over the day of the show( I understand that another teacher was in an emergency. I hope she will feel better soon. She is a very nice teacher but because of that, the other teacher has to give a different script and different position to kids? They couldn't communicate with each other(teachers) advanced just in case something would happen?) It wasn't professional at all. I was sitting very close to the stage. I saw the teacher very close, She was holding a little tambourine on her other hand and saying almost every script with the sound of the tambourine. It sounds that every audience can hear her.  And the show was way too looong. It makes me tired to see the show. I could call that show a Halloween or a costume party!!! This company thinks that it builds a kid's confidence and they are proud of kids that they did a great job!!  From my eyes, It smells money to me!! At least my kids don't fit with this company. I told them that it is not the fault of kids' ability.This is about communication skills between teachers and between teacher and kids. But they don't want to listen and but keep saying  ""kids did great! we are proud of kids etc..."" over and over. They don't want to admit their mistake. Really I believe kids could do better and had confidence if the staffs communicate very well. But for that difficult condition with miscommunication, Kids did really well. Another thing is that this company doesn't hand in any copies of script advance to kids. Only the teacher has the script because of copyright?? of course, some younger kids can't remember the script. If they say copyright? What about kids' right??? I really can't see their common sense and their point. They offered me 2 weeks free summer camp which costs over $$400. But said ""No thanks"". Because I don't really see the point what they are doing and most importantly I don't want to waste my kid's time. I just can't stand the people who take advantage of parents who are in love of own kids and kids who are so pure, but the people don't do a responsible, serious job. Pure Kids can't say anything. Most of the kids believe this adults from Drama Kids are doing the right things. I hope my review helps some parents who really think for their kids, who are low-income family as well.

I recommend a delux pedicure which is one of the treatments that I got. I soaked my feet in a lavender solution for around 15 minutes while relaxing in the massage chair. I then received a sugar scrub on my feet and legs, a wrap, callus treatment, and 10 minute foot and leg massage. The entire process was about an hour and it was so relaxing. I don't recommend this treatment if you need a quick in-and-out pedicure!

I then got a regular manicure which was needed. I also got my eyebrows waxed which left my brows a little red, but no complaints for only $12. I thought the prices were worth it ($45 for the pedicure worth every penny), $20 for the Mani and $12 for my brows. The service was excellent and the environment was relaxing.

The problem I have with Vegas dealerships are the outlandish doc fees.  What you pay $6-800 here for, you get for $85 in California, so that gets you a good car at a good price, but also a free vacation to California to pick up the car.  When you're purchasing a car, California is the way to go, more competition means better pricing for you.

However, when leasing a car, the goal is to get the lowest price possible, so your lease payment is where you want it.  If you get the car you want for the lease payment you want, then the doc fee doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things.

It was suggested to me to talk with Rami at BMW of Las Vegas and it was a great suggestion.  I got an amazing car, I got an amazing deal, and I got something I've only gotten from one other dealership in Las Vegas (MINI) --- the feeling that the dealership was on my side to get a good deal AND the dealership got me to that deal!  

The reason I left MINI is because of their Service Department --- that's another long story - trust... If BMW of Las Vegas' Service Department makes me a believer in the Service process, then I see a long relationship with this dealership and with Rami.  So far, everything has been stellar...

We also met with Eric at the dealership and I thought for sure, 'oh boy, here comes the hard sell muscle...'  Eric was just as impressive as Rami and I'm happy to refer everyone and anyone to them.  If they can change the attitudes about working with out of state dealerships, BMWs will be flying off their lots.  GREAT WORK GUYS!

There were only two people ahead of us in line so we were seated quickly. After a few minutes someone came to take our drink orders. We were ready to order since we all had our hearts set on the steak and eggs, but the guy would not take our order since he was just in charge of drinks apparently. We also later heard him chewing out a fellow employee. It was loud enough for us to hear even though they were in the back. After a few more minutes a pleasant young waitress came to take our food orders: 7 steak and eggs. It took a long time to get our food. People who came after us got their food first, although I think the size of our group had something to do with that. We got so bored we started playing Keno. Two new employees that we had never seen before brought our food. It was interesting how overstaffed the place seemed compared to the other little coffee shops in Vegas. Still, that didn't mean we got good service. After dropping off the food, the only other employee that came to our table was the waitress dropping off the bill and telling us to pay up front; which was about 2 minutes after getting our food. 

The steak and eggs looked good, but the steaks were so tough. It was actually kind of hard to cut them with steak knives. They went through the effort of sticking the little flag in each steak to indicate how they were cooked, but each one seemed at least medium-well. The eggs, hash browns, and toast were edible though. 

It was actually a good bonding experience in the end. We joked about how horrible our meal was the rest of the trip. I thought that maybe we just had a bad meal or maybe they cut corners on the special, but seeing all the other bad reviews on here, I wonder if maybe they just have no idea what their doing.

The hotel was ok, older style and decor but the large size and kitchenette made up for it. I would have stayed here again but this is so shady, very bad business! Do you secretly charge everyone just to see what you can get away with and who doesn't notice? I don't expect this hotel to stay in business much longer with this kind of reputation and poor, dishonest business practices.

We got a nice seat on the patio so we could see the shows, and that certainly adds ambience and is fun.  They had three different shows in rotation around the waterfall while we were there...one rated G, one rated PG-13, and the other rated Avatar-ish.  Service here was quite good once our orders were taken.  It did however, take a while to get our orders taken and was commented by another person in our party.  It was OK though as we were in no hurry.

I was excited to eat at this ""French"" Brasserie, especially knowing it's received one Michelen Star.  Well, the menu isn't what I'd consider overly French.  Mostly American with some French items or French influence.  Yes, the have fois gras, mussels, steak frites, and escargot, but they also serve a hamburger. (albeit w/ fois gras and black truffle for $32)  The wine list is extensive, but the prices are maxed out on the pricing as most wines I saw were at least 3x what you'd be able to get them at retail.

I got the escargot for an app, and although it was my first try of escargot, they were quite tasty with a nice sauce and seasoned deftly with just enough garlic to know there's some garlic butter in there.  They came w/ out the shells as well, although I was hoping for the experience of digging them out of the shells from a French place.  For my entree, I got the duck confit.  I recently ate at a Denver restaurant with the best duck confit I've had and wanted to compare to a Michelin rated restaurant.  Sadly, it was no comparison.  The duck was slightly overcooked and a bit dry in comparison.  The skin was a bit too crisp IMO.  The sauce was excellent and the seasoning was spot on.  My wife's halibut however was to die for.  The mussels were also very well done.

I'm actually surprised this place has a Michelin Star.  I've eaten at Michael Mina's which also has one Michelin Star, and Michael Minas blows this place out of the water as far as food goes IMO.  If I'm going to drop that much ching on a meal, I'll gladly go to Michael Minas.  It's not that this was bad, but not worth it and they've either gone downhill since receiving their star or Michelin isn't what it should be. (I've heard from locals that this place isn't what it once was, but that's just hearsay)",6/7/2010 7:59,36.1142559,-115.1336195,1495 E Flamingo Rd,NV,Las Vegas,89119,"Fashion, Shoe Stores, Sporting Goods, Shopping, Women's Clothing, Men's Clothing",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Skechers

Most certainly not a connoisseur of dim sum but having now visited a handful of the reported 'best' in North America from Toronto to Vancouver/Richmond and down to the San Gabriel Valley it was with high hopes that I entered KJ Dim Sum at The Rio alongside a friend and with the restaurant packed to overflowing with Asians both local and visiting the carts and service that awaited rendered an admirable effort the sorts of which many would have you believe cannot be found in Las Vegas.  Admittedly a 'standardized' menu featuring solid renditions of the classics but little innovation it would be easy for me to dock points for issues such as tepid duck or small, slightly overcooked shrimp but taking into account the nature of cart service compared to the menu style common to the elite of the SGV or BC nearly every dish we selected was nicely prepared and ample in portion, the total bill for 11 selections ringing in at $45 before tax and tip.  Speaking to specific must orders, particular favorites particularly well done would include both the baked salty egg yolk buns and the even more impressive steamed version of the same, but most of all the golf-ball sized crispy shrimp balls served along semi-sweet Chinese mayo sauce - the rich, supple interior so good a second order for 'dessert' proved mandatory.",12/30/2013 20:48,36.132668,-115.16398,"3025 Las Vegas Blvd S, Ste A",NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Drugstores, Food, Photography Stores & Services, Convenience Stores, Cosmetics & Beauty Supply, Shopping, Beauty & Spas",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,Shopping,,,Restaurants_FoodShopping,Walgreens

My family talked Gordon Ramsay Steakhouse up like it was one of the best restaurants they have ever visited. 
Being from the Napa Valley my whole life, my food and wine taste are a little high maintenance and have made my quality of service a very important part of the experience. Which is why I was so disappointed with the experience as a whole. 
To start....We had a reservation and still got sat 25 min. Later. (Whatever no big deal) right? It's a restaurant. So I let that go. 
Then...the hostess that sat us was very nice and made the trip up the elevator a pleasant one. (To the top floor of the restaurant)
This is the annoying part....we didn't get acknowledged by anyone for 10 min. Then when we did we were handed our menus and an iPad to look at the drink menu. (My sister started to look at the wine list and the iPad died)...
Now...I'm thinking can we at least get water? Lol now everyone with me is starting to get a little annoyed. 
Finally...15 min. Later Into sitting there...our server greets us and is clearly not excited to be there. (Maybe he had a hard night) so I don't want to judge to harshly, but it really did ruin our experience. We felt like an inconvenience more than welcomed guest. 

HERES THE THING...that's the most disappointing... THE FOOD WAS SO GOOD. 

We had to wait forever. It was not the high class experience I was wanting to pay for. But the food was good. 
So I guess you have to decide if it's worth it. 
If the service was waaaayyy better, I would have given it at least 4 stars. Right up there with one of the prestigious Napa restaurants.

Despite the digital age this store survived the crash for now.  When I look around some titles seem irrelevant.  Books make an easy gift and this location is convenient.  That being said the day I was visiting with a friend that was browsing around I walked a few rows back where they usually have the marked down books.  One area had shelves that were empty and had vertical lucite dividers with calendar books to the right.  I paused here for a moment and out of the corner of my eye a man was walking toward me quickly from my left.  He grabbed one of the lucite dividers that was directly in front of me at my eye level and kept his hand on it for a brief time.  This action made absolutely no sense in a shopping type of way since he was completely invading my space to the point that his arm was almost touching me.  As quickly as he approached he continued to move thru the aisle and disappeared.  Now he was dressed in all black and he was wearing a trappers hat.  Meaning a hat that you can fold down flaps onto your ears and around the back of your neck ( it was one of the colder days ) to possible hide his identity.  I don't know anyone personally in Henderson so this is a mystery to me.  He could have been trying to distract me to grab my purse maybe?  So ladies I would hold onto my purse or not use one at all and keep kids close by when you are in this store since he could have been hiding between the shelves.  Everyone knows crime has escalated in Henderson in the last 10 years and this def seems like it could be a crime tactic.,3/19/2017 6:09,36.203982,-115.2227397,6038 Smoke ranch rd,NV,Las Vegas,89108,"Home & Garden, Mattresses, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Mattress By Appointment

If you get there during the rush hour you can be a little intimidated by the line, but if you are looking for a buffet this is the place to go. The line can get a bit long at the crab leg station. You have your choice of snow (hot or cold), king, dungeness, sea snails, oysters. You name it. I couldn't stop thinking what bottomless ocean did they find all this crab to feed people every day. There is an Asian station with sushi, fried rice, vegetables, fried rice, Peking duck etc. A salad bar. A southern bar with mash potatoes, mac and cheese, ribs, steaks. A huge dessert bar. I can keep going on about the amount of food choices and different cuisines.The staff was extremely friendly and met our every need.

Plus with all most of our group of ladies wanting wine; this ultimately was in the cards. Italian food and wine pair so deliciously together. One of the ladies in our group lives close to this restaurant so we would not have far to drive home after dinner being so close to her house. Then, after dinner we all drove back to her house with leftovers, and continued the party at her house.

Our group was seated in the patio area and it was late enough in the evening that the heat was not an issue. Those nightly Vegas breezes that come from the mountains are amazing too out here on the patio. The restaurant is very warm and pleasant with a modern edge in architecture. On the front landscape they use desert plants to decorate such as the huge agave as you walk in the front door. The color scheme they use is a mix of brown that makes the restaurant very appealing and clean feeling. The staff are very considerate and friendly too.

Most of us started with white wine and then when dinner came, since most of our glasses were empty we switched to Sangrias. We dined here on a Wednesday too, so we received a wonderful surprise  on wine , going with the bottle was amazing. Our Sangrias bottle was half price, so we ordered two bottles with eight of us. For dinner we ordered two 10 x 18 pizza with three toppings each. The first one had pepperoni, feta, and mushroom. The second pizza had mozzarella, olive, and feta. Their pizzas are very delicious too.

Our server delivered flawless service to our group and was so polite. She constantly continued to ensure that we had all we needed with such a large group of guests. The pizzas that we ordered for our extra extended party later at the house were all correct. Our server was the one who prepared that order as well.

- weird, office-like swivle chairs.  Uncomfortable & they kill the ambiance of an otherwise decent restaurant.
-  beef filets, even when prepared medium rare, were dry.
-  when your food arrives there are a ton of waitstaff, but drinks were refilled too rarely & some in my party didn't get new silverware after the appetizer utensils were cleared.
-  bernaise sauce was kind of weak.  I'd expected more.  The shallot - red wine reduction was tastier.
-  they told us we'd reserved the ""banquet room"" and when we should up it was just two long tables standing next to one another in the middle of the dining room.  We wanted to do toasts for the groom but couldn't really without ruining everyone else's dining experience.  Kinda felt like they misrepresented the space, it wasn't at all what you'd think of as a ""banquet room"".

Good stuff:
-  most everything else positive!
-  one of the best pork chops I've ever tasted
-  very generous portions (if I'm paying 38 bucks for a pork chop can I really say that?  I say ""yes, I can"".  It was big, juicy, and the size was enormous.  worth the money).  Each of the sides were large as well.  Unless you're super hungry and just a glutton in general, you should plan to share the app's.
-  raw Kobe app with Asian spices was a bit too salty, but the flavors & texture was otherwise satisfying.  
-  poached egg, asparagus, & bacon app was awkward to eat but was sinfully tasty!
-  mash potatoes were good but the $25 addition of black truffles didn't do much for me
-  Wine was served properly and efficiently
-  Tara, our waitress, we perfect.  She dealt with my group of buddies professionally without being cold.  She gave us honest answers to our questions and made sure to stop by frequently to see if we needed anything.

Yes, it is a playground for adults who enjoy their buzzy beverages(raises hand). Yes, they have a great selection and pretty damn good prices. Where they suffer though sometimes is their customer service. 

I frequent this location for wine mostly and sometimes I find that the employees want to help, check on me, ask if I need anything, and other times they couldn`t care less. I could slip and fall and they would just walk right by me, trying not to look. Today was one of those days. I popped in around 1 p.m. and I was browsing, looking at my phone, trying to remember a wine name I saw online, walking back and forth and I saw not one, not two, but three employees who made eye contact with me and then looked away and wandered off. I thought to myself ""I don`t get it. I`m not scary. Do I smell?"" Total Wine employees: you are giving me complexes. 

No one asked me if I needed help(I clearly did, but I figured it out on my own as usual). I did walk by the tasting area and the lady asked if she could pour me a sample(sure!) She was very nice, but I saw her earlier when I was in the aisle directly in front of the tasting station and she didn`t say anything to me. To be clear, THE STORE WAS NOT BUSY. It was the middle of the day(when I like to shop to avoid crowds) and there wasn't any traffic. The nail in the coffin, though, was the check out lady. She was pleasant enough, but when I asked what the perks were for joining their rewards program, she said ""you earn points and we send you coupons"" and didn`t bother to ask if I wanted to join or tell me how I could join. It just annoyed me. She seemed more interested in finishing the transaction quickly and talking with her co-worker than helping me. 

I hope my next trip is better because I really do like this place, but the customer service is a definite downer sometimes.",6/29/2017 23:16,36.1356534,-115.1615056,2901 Las Vegas Blvd S,NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Local Flavor, Art Galleries, Arts & Entertainment, Public Services & Government, Landmarks & Historical Buildings, Shopping, Adult Entertainment, Nightlife",,,,,Shopping,,Entertainment,ShoppingEntertainment,Crazy Girls Bronze Sculpture

We ordered the curry goat and whole fish - red snapper. started with codfish fritters ( big surprise - another restaurant.com coupon ) 

they bring you a basket of chips with bean dip ( sorry babe, you are gonna hate me later tonite ! ) 

As with my past visits, the food is good, it's home-cookin' good. Without the coupon, the pricing might be a little high ( the goat $16, the fish $23 ) but it comes with some great plantains, cabbage, and other veggies so it's a complete meal. 

The place might also have an identity crisis - is it Jamaican ? Nicaraguan ? Mexican ? American ? The menu is very large. 

I still like the place and hopefully it makes it !

for lunch i had a cup of gumbo which was alright, a tasty buffalo chicken sandwich and my wife had a pulled pork sandwich which she enjoyed.  tons of fries served with each sandwich.  more than enough food.  we used a $25 restaurant.com certificate.  with that and added in tax and gratuity our total bill was only $19.  so lunch ended up being cheaper than happy hour.  thank goodness for no musician.",8/19/2010 21:41,36.1472673,-115.299964,"9350 W Sahara Ave, Ste 120",NV,Las Vegas,89117,"Arts & Crafts, Arts & Entertainment, Shopping, Paint-Your-Own Pottery, Art Classes, Event Planning & Services, Education, Venues & Event Spaces, Party & Event Planning, Kids Activities, Active Life, Team Building Activities",,,,,Shopping,,Entertainment,ShoppingEntertainment,Color Me Mine

- car is not dry.
- vacuums are weak
- no towels.

Was excited to try it because it's new and everyone kept telling me all hood things about it.

First of all check in is easy. It has multiple drive through spots where you stop and pay at computer/ atm looking thing. Gate opens and they tell you to drive to the wash.
Wash itself seems a little harsh. My passenger side mirror almost got ripped off. For $7 you basically get spray with soapy water. I would suggest right away trying $10 at least colorful soap would keep you or your kids entertained.
After getting out wash tunnel you will have a lot of water still on your car. No one dries it with towels. You can stop buy at vacuum stations which they have a few of them. And use air pressure. It's nice for those spots where water get trapped and can't be reached with towel. But to get most of the water off of car is time consuming. 
Vacuums are weak! Seriously wouldn't pick up anything. It felt like too many cars were using it at the same time and it lost suction.

Overall one time to try and forget.
Drive through wash supposed to be easy and not make you get out of your vehicle and work.
I'll go back to Stephanie and lasso Verde has statin. For $11 you go through tunnel and after athey will hand dry water that lingers.

Our dog, Doc, was seen by Dr. B for a large mass that he had growing on the base of his tail. The mass was too close to the base of his tail and docking the tail wasn't an option because of potential nerve damage so our only option was surgery. We became the people we said we wouldn't--we had kids and our dogs went on the back burner. By the time we were able to afford the surgery his mass was a whopping 4.5 lbs. Personally, we felt like terrible dog parents (to say the least) but we were not treated as such. We were never asked, ""why did you let this grow for so long"" or made to feel bad in any way. It was all about how we can remedy this situation-how we can get Doc healthy, mass-free and feeling better. Dr. B let us know that our option was (obviously) surgery but because of the location of the mass and how close it was to the base of his spine, he wouldn't be able to take out the margins around the mass that he normally would. We understood and had the surgery done anyway because he (Doc) was in constant discomfort/pain. The morning of the surgery my wife and I were very emotional and concerned that we wouldn't see our ""first born"" after the morning drop-off. Little did we know that we would be receiving text message status updates from Pet Health throughout the day. These updates gave us peace of mind, to say the least. Doc went through a 3-4 hour surgery and had that awful 4.5 lb mast cell tumor removed! The histopathology came back a week later and Dr B. called us with the results. Although it read that it was a stage 2 mast cell tumor, Dr. B. said he was hopeful that it wouldn't grow back. His surgery was March 9, 2017 and we haven't seen any growth yet. He is back to his old self and we couldn't be happier or more thankful. Thank you Dr. B. and everyone at Pet Health!",6/6/2017 23:23,36.0424104,-115.0272296,"980 American Pacific Dr, Ste 107",NV,Henderson,89014,"Archery, Active Life, Sporting Goods, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Aces & Arrows Archery

Then they top it off with a macaron of your choice. I tried the passionfruit, salted butter caramel, raspberry and stracciatella. It was delicious, flavorful and a perfect amount of sweetness!

You order and pay first then you get to sample anything you want. They have so many flavors to choose from and almost every one is so good that it's hard to choose from.

The work they do at Three Square to help feed the hungry of our community is incredible.  If you are looking to help out and give back, come here.  I've been wanting to volunteer at this facility since I heard about it, but it's difficult with my work schedule during the week.  Three Square has volunteer hours available on the first Saturday of the month for individuals and groups and I thought it would be great to get some friends together for my first time.  We worked the three hour shift, from 9:00am to 12:00pm sorting and packing food for distribution.  Patti Johnson, the fabulous and friendly volunteer coordinator, gave us a tour of the facility first and explained the history of the food bank--impressive to say the least -the warehouse looks like Costco!  Three Square takes donations, sorts them, packs them, and then ships them off to local food pantries, shelters, non-profits, etc.  They also have a a program for food-insecure senior citizens, a backpack program for children who need food over the weekend, as well as an after-school and summer time program for the kids.  
If you're looking for a place to volunteer some time and give back to the community, look no further than Three Square.  For more info on how you can help, check out their website:  http://www.threesquare.org/

The salad is something to behold. They actually bring a cart to your table with about 20 different items and make it fresh for you at the table. The steaks are huge and I recommend always getting the smallest cut. The restaurant is pricey. We go here only for special occasions when in Vegas or if we win big! 

You can't go wrong with the Prime Rib or the Filet Mignon. I haven't ever tried a fish dish as the steaks are so delicious I can't being myself to try something new.

This was my girlfriend's first time in Las Vegas, so I wanted to bring her to an upscale place and have her try some food from supposedly exclusive restaurants in vegas. Based on the yelp reviews, and time availability, I chose Scarpetta. It was a major disappointment, and I felt so bad bringing her to this establishment. This was the first restaurant experience she had in Vegas and it was horrendous. 

Let me say that this review is based on three dishes that we had at Scarpetta. 

1. Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli (main course)
2. Short Rib Agnolotti (main course)
3. Roasted Diver Scallops (appetizer)

Ambiance:

The seating and view were great. We were the table almost next to the window where the Belagio water show was going on. There was a great view of the show. The lighting was also dim. It is definitely a nice place to bring a date.

Price:

Despite the $$$, the prices are not too outrageous for Las Vegas. The main course dishes were 25 and 26 dollars while the roasted scallops were 23 dollars. 

Service:

Service was horrible. We were there for over an hour. Our waiter checked up on us twice, once to bring more water and the second time to see if our food was ready. We waited for about 15-20 minutes to get our scallop appetizer. No apologies or more complementary bread. The wait for the food seemed the norm, as the tables next to us finished their food and were just making small talk while waiting for over 20 minutes. After we finished our scallops, we proceeded to wait another almost 30 minutes for our main course. Again, no apologies or further check ups. I ran out of water while waiting for our main course, during the appetizer, and did not get a refill until I had to ask for one (after the main course came). When we wanted to tell the waiter about the problems with our main courses, he and other waiters could not be found for about 20 minutes. We just sat there looking at each other and our plates (almost untouched). Simply horrible.

Food:

Scallops - these were actually very good. They were simple scallops that were fresh and cooked well. I would definitely get this again.

Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli - came out cold, tough, and very very very salty. We have had foie gras before, and this was well beyond what it was supposed to taste like. It left a bitter and salty taste in the mouth that could only be drowned out by eating the complimentary bread with their house tomato sauce. My girlfriend did not want to waste food so she tried to put the ravioli in her mouth followed by water as a chaser. She soon became sick and had to go to the bathroom. She only finished about 1/3 of the plate before I told her to stop. 

Short Rib Agnolotti - gross. The noodles were tough and cold. The sauce made the bread crumbs stick to the noodles and caused the noodles to stick together like one giant pasta. I had trouble eating one bite of it. After finally taking a bit, the food was bland and left an unpleasant aftertaste. It was one of the worst dishes I have had in a long time. I am usually not too picky with pasta, but this Agnolotti was inedible. The noodles were rubbery hard and the sauce was cold and crusted onto the noodles. The appearance did not help. The food looked like someone threw up on the plate. The sauce was black or very dark brown (could not tell because of the dim lighting), but the appearance made the food even less appetizing. 

Conclusion of the meal:

After about 20 minutes of the food being on the plate, almost completely untouched, the waiter came by to ask ""how was everything tasting."" I told the waiter that the food was inedible and that it was probably the worst thing I've had in recent memory. The waiter's face was priceless. He did not seem shocked at all, rather, he just appeared to be apologetic. The waiter took the food off our table and asked if we wanted anything else. At this point, the restaurant was about to close and we did not want to wait another 30 minutes to get some inedible food. I told him to just give me the check so we can get out of there. They took the two dishes off our bill and our almost 2 hour meal came out to a whopping $23 (for the scallops). What a waste of time and appetite.

This trend of inedible food was not isolated to only our table table. While waiting for our food, the table behind us asked for the check and had two dishes that were inedible and left untouched as well. I did hear that the fish was decent from the table behind us, but that was the extent of praise Scarpetta's food received. 

Overall:

I felt the need to write a long rant about this place. This dinner was supposed to be a happy and memorable event for my girlfriend because it was her very first dinner in vegas. Instead, it was only memorable because of how bad the restaurant service and food were. Considering there are a ton of great great places in vegas, I would highly advise anyone to pass on Scarpetta.",10/11/2014 0:29,36.2406248,-115.1715389,2020 W Craig Rd,NV,North Las Vegas,89030,"Home Decor, Shopping, Home & Garden, Mattresses, Furniture Stores",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Mattress Firm Las Vegas North

They don't just have desserts, but also have appetizers, quiches, and sandwiches.  I have had the crab quiche and the salmon croissant, I prefer the flavors of the croissant I had the best.   The salmon is cooked perfect and has a great sauce, nice greens, and ikura!  Both came with a soup and dessert.  I got the lobster tomato soup each time, it's served in a tiny cup and so yummy.  Salad is greens in a light citrus dressing and potato salad.  The desserts are wonderful to watch being made, and if it's someone's birthday they will malwnit extra special.  I have had the red tiramisu, and the Carib served in the big wine class.  My favorite was the carib it had so many flavors and textures that meld together into something amazing!

We tried what felt like the entire menu...Veal cheeks, paella with squid ink and shrimp, little grilled cheese sandwiches, stuffed pasilla peppers, a fried egg with caviar...and the list goes on and on.  The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the veal cheeks.  I'm not sure if its because it was the last thing we ate and I was already full, or if I just didn't like the flavor.

We expressed our concern as this would cut into our day-trip to the Grand Canyon and they said: ""We can't guarantee cars for people who book less than 24hrs in advance."" That's when I lost it and said we booked almost two months prior to this trip! Specifically for a convertible to drive out to the Grand Canyon for our anniversary. After about 15 minutes telling us the things they can't-do, they finally shuffled things around and about an hour and a half later we drove ourselves to the Las Vegas Airport in a car they needed to return there, to pick up the car we were promised. (You're welcome for doing your job BTW.)

I was very disappointed with the customer service here. They acted as if they were doing us a favor the entire time and their attitudes were not welcoming at all. We called HQ and they were equally as unhelpful as this location and offered us minimal credit for future use... lol. 

This was my last time renting from any Budget location.

""just the right amount of wrong""???
i don't get it....

anyway...

another all suite hotel hits the las vegas strip and the cosmopolitan of las vegas takes it all to another level.
although it seemingly caters to a ""younger"" crowd, the service and amenities would satisfy even the most discerning of guests.

the hubby and i took a little staycation here in january (a mere 15 days after the official grand opening).
being pretty savvy travelers, we were aware of the possibility of the typical noob glitches (and there certainly were some serious glitches) so we weren't surprised when the entire hotel's network went down the day we checked in.
everything connected to their network wasn't working....tvs, phones, pos systems, even the slot machine's ticket payout system wasn't working so casino employees were walking around hand paying everyone...all with a smile and an apology.
with that said, i can still easily give them 5 stars.

let's start with the parking garage.
every single space in the AWESOME underground parking garage has a sensor and a light indicating whether it's vacant (green light) or occupied (red light).
allowing drivers to see from greater distances whether or not there are available spaces to park.
talk about convenience!

front desk is conveniently located just as you exit the parking garage elevators.
as you approach the front desk, you are pleasantly greeted by the agent and some may even come out behind their station to shake your hand.
wow!
it took us mere minutes to check in and we were off to our room on the 51st floor!

boy, were we pleasantly surprised.
51st floor with a balcony overlooking the bellagio fountains.
amazing!!!
homey hooked us up!
the rooms here are beautifully decorated and the bathrooms are killer.

the rest of our stay was just as great.
like i said, a few glitches but the entire staff was apologetic and went out of their way to make sure that our needs were met.

all in all, i'd say cosmopolitan (a marriott autograph collection hotel) is a great place to stay.",8/24/2011 10:52,36.054122,-115.169395,"7400 Las Vegas Blvd S, Ste 48",NV,Las Vegas,89123,"Watches, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Time Factory Watch Outlet

Food is amazing and inventive.

-Slow poached egg yolk with buttered bread tips, mash potatoes, and truffle
-Grilled Octopus
-Maine Day Boat Scallops
-Steak Tartare

Although the cocktails are quite spendy ($16-18 each), they are quite creative and well worth the splurge. I enjoyed the honey oat, which came with French brandy, oolong tea, lemon, kas krupnikas, yellow chartreuse, oat milk, and egg white. Quite the eclectic combination, no?

Similarly, the detox-retox was niftily named, featuring blended scotch, Venezuelan rum, pineapple rum, aged cachaca, coconut water, and angostura. A great way to get your booze on - and in plush, swanky environs too.

The food offerings are going to be quite spendy as well. Stick to dependable offerings like the dry-aged beef burger or fried chicken if you want to leave anywhere near full; otherwise, there are many other good food options nearby, since this is Vegas, after all.

I think people miss the point about the Monte Carlo.  Sure there's no attractions and it's kind of boring.  But, because of that, no one wants to stay there, it's rarely sold out, and they are forced to keep rates low.  It is right in the middle of the action on the strip, and the next step down in hotel is a pretty steep drop off.

The Monte Carlo is clean, modern, safe, centrally located, and has a decent array of dining options, just like its better-known siblings.  It is more of an adult hotel due to the lack of attractions for kids.  It has no interesting gimmicks like surrounding hotels but that's why you go visit them--you don't have to pay $400+/night to the Bellagio to enjoy the grounds.

The restaurants are great - particularly Japonais, but there could be a few more lunch options.

WHERE the hell is that?  3/4 mile from the strip?  Noooo!

Wait a second.  No casino?  Hmm, that means that it will be quieter, cleaner, and it won't take you an hour to navigate out to the street.  It's right in front of the monorail so you don't have to deal with cabbies trying to rip you off?  Whoa whoa whoa... 24/7 pool and hot tub?  SOLD!

So yes, it was a blessing in disguise.  The staff was very pleasant for the most part, and everyone was willing to give directions (even if each person gave you different directions).  The hotel was clean and 100% smoke free.  The rooms were fine, nothing crazy, but they were clean.  No view from our window, but the bed was pretty comfortable, there were a few comfy chairs for sitting, a desk with a small LCD tv on it, and plenty of closet space.  The bathroom was nice as well, with separate tub/shower and a nice modern feel.

In fact, this was such a blessing in disguise that I have a hard time believing that I will ever stay on the strip again.  Would I stay at Renaissance again?  Sure, the prices were reasonable, it was clean and quiet, and I loved the 24 hour hot tub access... what better way to wash away the day of dirty casinos, sweaty nightclubs, and the rest of the Vegas filth?  I might try another place off of the strip, but all in all the prices are reasonable and it's a solid hotel.

Wahlburgers apparently felt that there was room for one more overpriced chain in our market, so of course I had to check it out.  

Unfortunately, we chose a hot weekend day to visit and the wait was an over an hour long (waiting is outside).  They do use the texting system, so at least we could peruse the lackluster Grand Bizarre shops while we waited (I still don't get these shops).  We were texted that our table was ready about 65 min later and seated.

I question the layout of this space.  1. Because I'm not sure how anyone would know that they have a takeout counter in the back of the restaurant if you just want to pick up food and leave.  They don't even let you in the door to get on the wait list.  It's done outside.   2. We were seated at a booth with an I-beam at the edge of our table.  Horrible view, to say the least.  They should have been able to plan the seating better.

It took some time for our server to come over, so we were fully prepared to order when he arrived.  We got the Our Burger $10.95, the OFD $12.95, mac n' cheese $7.95, and an order of tots for $4.95, plus 2 fountain drinks $3.95 ea.  The food itself was pretty good; if I were at a quick service restaurant and the bill was $25, not $50 (plus tip) for paper cups and plastic ware.  The burgers at The Habit are as good, if not better, for a 1/3 of the price.

I think it will do well with tourists, but for locals it's probably a one and done kind of place IMO.",8/24/2016 1:55,36.1608501,-115.3334837,"10870 W Charleston Blvd, Ste 105",NV,Las Vegas,89135,"Health & Medical, Optometrists, Eyewear & Opticians, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Clearvision Eye Centers

The food's basically a hodge podge of tropical influenced cuisine.  It's a little  confusing to see Hawaiian names and foods next to Caribbean names and foods, but as Chris Rock would say - it's all right cause it's all white!  The quality of food is so-so, nothing to write home to ma.  Location is prime...I think TI is one of the better hotels destinations on the strip - huge parking garage, convenient location (near the highway on ramp), close to the gigantic mall, nice theme, good club (Tangerine)...but I digress.

So Kahunaville will try it's damnedest to entertain the crap out of you while you eat.  In a less than intrusive way, which I appreciated.  We ordered a couple of the sample appetizer plates which came with a fake volcano and deco pieces.  Every 45 minutes or so, they would dim the lights for the water show I'll call Baby Bellagio.  There's girls walking around in coconut bras, asking people if they want to get ""lei'd"" for $20...which is the cheapest lay on the Strip.  And of course, the professional bartender show, which gets everyone in a Spring-Break woo-hoo frame of mind.  Remember visiting Cancun for spring break, partying hard at the bars with Mexican dudes whistling and pouring drinks into half-naked girls' mouths?  Well, take away the Mexican dudes and add a little more clothes to the girls...that's what it was like :)",3/28/2007 1:56,36.1622324,-115.1516287,831 S Main St,NV,Las Vegas,89101,"Arts & Entertainment, Motorcycle Repair, Motorcycle Dealers, Motorcycle Gear, Art Galleries, Shopping, Automotive",,,,,Shopping,,Entertainment,ShoppingEntertainment,Main Street Moto

Most dishes were too salty - ie. stir fried beef and prawn. I wasn't hungry enough to order rice, which would have balanced out the heavily salted dishes we ordered. I did enjoy my dessert though, iced mango bamboo. There was no actual bamboo except that the chocolate was shaped like a bamboo and filled with mango sorbet. It was phenomenal!

I came with a group of wildly beautiful ladies, and the rest of the diners included police officers and perhaps some strip club goers?  Or maybe it was too early :)

Everyone ordered Thai iced tea or lemongrass juice, which apparently did not taste like lemongrass.  The Thai iced tea was generously (no promises for anyone visiting in the future) refilled, which I hear is really only unlimited at Weera Thai - this menu does not advertise free refills but I think the server was being sweet to our group.  I am not sure why there were dual prices on some dishes, because we thought it was lunch/dinner but I got charged the cheaper price so I am not clear on that.

We all ordered different things but I sampled everyone's dishes.  I had the spicy green beans with tofu in a chile paste/kaffir lime sauce spice 8 of 10.  It was definitely spicy and tasty.  No one was offered brown rice so I am not sure if we could have asked for it or not, but we all got white rice for dishes except for noodles of course.  My dish was good with heat and flavor, and I liked the tofu texture (sort of medium firm).

The other dishes I tried: pad kee mao with tofu (yay Chinese broccoli, but boo mushy noodles and had no spice - it had to be added with paste at our table), kool ginger beef (baby corn, unique non spicy sauce), beef panang (a bit thin but tasty), gang kua shrimp curry (not something I had ever tried, but it had pineapple and a nice flavor), and spicy mint chicken (chicken was ground which menu did not mention, but juicy - jalepenos supposed to be in dish but never saw them, loved the mint and basil in the dish).

Overall, everything tasted good except the mushy noodles, and the service and Thai tea were great.  I also really liked the atmosphere.  However, nothing can satisfy me like Komol and that darn herbal salad.  I am glad I tried a new place with foodie femmes and now I need to try Naga, Siri, and Le Thai apparently to catch up to everyone else!",3/22/2012 4:58,36.1445189,-115.2757054,"8450 W Sahara Ave, Ste 108",NV,Las Vegas,89117,"Books, Mags, Music & Video, Shopping, Musical Instruments & Teachers",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Today's Music

Takeout last night had several negative points:
My Hedary's salad was packaged in the same bag as my husband's combo meat dinner, so when it got home it was warm and limp. How hard is it to package the cold items in a separate plastic bag?

That salad (that I've had many times eating at the restaurant) is usually amazing. Tons of fresh tomatoes and cucumbers and feta. My salad last night was a styrofoam box full of lettuce with barely a topping in sight. The tiniest sprinkle of feta. Not worth the price and if I wanted a box of lettuce, I could have bought it at the grocery store. 

My husband enjoyed his meat platter and the rice was delicious as usual. The hummus was outstanding. The pitas were cold and stale but I wouldn't expect them to be as fresh as they are in the restaurant for a takeout order anyway.

The chicken was only slightly better so my husband and I both ordered the chicken. It came with rice which was neither fluffy nor flavorful. The largest portion on the plate was the salad which was okay. I found it to be the most edible thing on the plate. The pita bread was your basic packaged pita. 

The chicken and the rice were so dry and bland that my husband and I left all but a couple of forkfuls and gave the rest to our dogs who were also indifferent. They ate it anyway but not with the same enthusiasm as for other leftovers.

This is not the first time we've taken our pup to Lazy Dog, the first time we knew he was matted and needed to be shaved down. This time, we took special care to get the right brushes and brush him out properly. His hair is very dense, yes... but it seem like their only answer to a more difficult grooming task is to say the dog is matted and needs to be shaved.

 - Arrived at 3:20p for our 3:30p couples 90 Hot Stone massage appointment and was told that they weren't properly staffed and would need to wait about 20 minutes.  I said, ""Ok. So 3:45p?"" Receptionist said, ""yes.""  I said, ""We are going to get something to eat.""   As we walked to the Ethiopian restaurant next door (which is great BTW) the receptionist ran out the door after us and said, ""If you're not back in time we cannot give you the massage."" Uhhhh... ok.  ""No problem,"" I replied.   We rush through our meal to get back by 3:45 to ensure we didn't miss our appointment and had to wait another 20 minutes to 4:05.  
- The water for the foot soak was tepid,  The container for feet was small. I'm an average sized foot dude, and it was cramped for me. 
 - The massage was supposed to be hot stones, which lasted about 5 minutes of the entire 90 minute experience. 
- The two massage therapists talked throughout the ENTIRE session.  My wife said to me afterward, ""Do you think if we spoke their language, that they would've been talking the entire time?""  ""No.... "" I replied. 
 - Technique was amateur at best.  No regard for trying to sense what was going on with my body, just rubbing and then at exactly 90 minutes.  Good bye.  No bedside manner. 
 - Then while waiting in the lobby for my wife, the therapist and receptionist started staring at me waiting for a tip.   Nah..... Not today.   
Not for being 45 minutes late,  not for the poor service, not for the abrupt service.  

Perhaps my experience was the exception.  Unfortunately, that's all I have to go off of.

You take your food, find a seat and eat up. I got a drink with my order and the total came to a little over $10. The food portion was very generous. My sandwich had a lot of pork and veggies. My soup was in a big bowl. It also comes with a chocolate covered strawberry.

gfQO1fpqkKjUGUWTTzTAww,M_JB5tiXDnpoBTXYwzyIvQ,PDIh1lVtKlUqPJROXYJQvQ,1,1,0,0,"The epitome of a Las Vegas Dining Tourist Trap.

Their menu is so unbelievably over-priced for uninspired food, presented under the guise of sophistication, that it borders on comical and is certainly cliched.

We ordered several appetizers for our party of 4, which we shared as our meal.

Spicy Tuna: Great dish that is a common appetizer at many, many sushi places. A small dollop of spicy tuna served atop a deep-fried block of sushi rice. Tasted fine. Nothing out of the ordinary. At most places this is a $6 - 8 dollar appetizer. Here, its $25 - and you get 5 pieces that are about 1"" square. 

Chopped Nicoise Salad: I don't even know where to begin with this one . . . the portion served was comparable to a side-salad you'd get at a place like Denny's. The ingredients were fresh and presentation was nice, I'll give it that, but was it worth $19? Unequivocally, no.

Kobe chili cheese fries: This might be the worst offender, which we ordered for the sheer comedy of it. I love how places add ""kobe"" to the listing and assume that this allows them to triple the price. Any restaurant who is using legitimate kobe beef, is: a) NOT going to grind it and b) NOT put it into CHILI. What you get here is a nicely arranged log cabin of french fries, a small crock of ""kobe"" chili, (aka steak timmings simmered in tomato sauce), and a little container of some sort of melted cheese sauce, which is most certainly more cream than cheese, as it never solidified despite sitting on our table for close to an hour. This was $21 - just under a buck a fry.

The ""Very adult"" mac and cheese: Ugh . . . I'm pretty sure I've seen these at Costco for something like $20 a case. Its macaroni and cheese, tossed with a piece or two of proscuitto, shaped into a log and deep fried. Please . . . Four pieces for $14

Bobby Baldwin Burgers: one of their ""signature"" dishes. All of the same as noted with the chili above applies here too. You get 3 sliders - which are exactly the same size as any other slider - for $31 dollars. That's $10 a piece. Absurdity.

Whole roasted cauliflower: aside from the fact that a) you are served a CHOPPED head of cauliflower (contrary to the description of ""whole""); b) there were no raisins or hazelnuts; and c) the menu SHOULD read ""brown butter bath"", this was the best appetizer we had. I don't know where they shop, but at my local Whole Foods, I can get a head of cauliflower for about $13 less than the $14 price, and I'm not buying by the case.

Drinks/bar:

a) Hire a proper sommelier, please. The wine selection is very mediocre for Las Vegas, though the prices are far above average.

b) Hire a proper mixologist, please. There are about 3 - 4 speciality cocktails, and they're rather uninspired. A pineapple mojito? Please.

Service: service was fine for our table. We weren't left wanting for anything, water was promptly refilled, and they were attentive. HOWEVER. Serious warning here:

A food runner brought an appetizer to our table, set it down and walked away. One which we did not order, as this happened within several moments of us sitting down. About a minute later, just as we began to reach for the mystery appetizer, another waiter ran over, snatched up the plate and apologized that it had been given to the wrong table. The waiter then turned around, placed the very same appetizer that had just been sitting on our table, onto the table behind us. Not only is this likely a health code violation, its disgusting. We were immediately turned off and wondered where else our food had been prior to arriving at our table. The proper course of action here would have been to leave the appetizer with us and prepare a new one for the table who actually ordered it.

There is also clearly a ventilation problem in the kitchen. Its hot in Vegas. I know that. I live here. Our server, however, regularly came out of the kitchen, sweat dripping off his forehead and down his face. He was not the only one either. I tried (very hard) to not imagine the chef's sweat dripping into my food.

Ambiance: note that the dining room is basically on the casino floor. If you like the smell of smoke wafting into your meal, the sounds of slot machines chiming away and passerby's staring at you as you eat, then this is the place for you.

Grand total for 4 people: $240 with 18% tip. Again, none of us ordered an actual entree.

I have no problem paying that much for a meal . . . its not the dollar amount thats the problem. Its what you get for that price. The food was very mediocre - not bad, but certainly not good either. Drinks were very substandard. Service was fine, but serious sanitary concerns. The only reason this place can charge as much as it does is because its on the strip and in the Bellagio. They're clearly catering to the tourist crowd looking for a fine-dining experience, hoping to capitalize on travelers who don't know any better.

This was my first really big trip to vegas, and I came ready to spend anything to have a great time. I'm a male.

I was with was a smoking babe and we were dressed in pretty high end clothes, so we talked to the bouncers and were polite and they let us in a faster guest line. There were 15 people in the line, so we evaded the 500 person regular line. Cool. Groups of annoying girls who looked 18 got let in without any line, not sure who they knew.

In 30 minutes, we were in. The tickets all say ""VIP"" on them, and that is kind of offensive because all I did was get into a club, why on earth does that make me very important? The place was so crowded that we couldn't go anywhere. Drunk people were stumbling everywhere, felt like we were in a college bar. The dance floor was so packed that none of the people were moving. The music was repetitive. The songs went on forever and sounded exactly the same; there were no words, which is likely 50% of the reason no one was dancing. We saw zero very attractive people. By the end of the night we were dying to hear just ONE LMFAO song; we followed a herd of drunks out of the ugly, sticky stairwell and couldn't get the beats out of our heads till the next morning. Money wasn't a big deal, but we wasted a lot of time here! I think coming here not on a saturday or friday would be better.

But, it still gets 3 stars because the Marquee Dayclub was amazing. We got here at 11AM and got in for free (again, we were polite and dressed very nicely). Everyone was sexy including all of the bartenders. For you women, half of the dudes were jacked and handsome. For men, I've been coast to coast and never seen so many babes in such a small place.

Everything is homemade and the ingredients are always fresh.  The service is always very friendly, and even though it's more of a fast-food set up, they are always coming by to make sure everything is ok.  The space is homey and casual.

The salad, hummus, and pita never disappoint.  I usually get the veggie skewers and my husband usually orders the veggie gyro.  When we really want to pig out, we order the combo appetizer platter as well.

I've been back twice since moving here, so I suppose I'd call myself a regular at this point? Especially having only called Sun City home since early June. Sharing the Chicken Fried Steak is necessary because it's huge, but also a tasting experience that you want to remember with someone. The gravy is tantalizing and the potatoes are incredible. The corned beef hash is good, but I'm more of a shredded Corned Beef fan and this dish is small chunks. The toast is thick cut and perfect for soaking up that egg yolk. 

My most recent visit took me to the sandwich side of things. The chicken sandwich is simple, the bread perfectly toasted. I'd have added avocado, as the pesto didn't add as much flavor as I had hoped, but the menu clearly states that modifications will be politely declined. The grilled cheese should be framed. The thick cut toast filled with melted cheese makes me weak in the knees. And it's ideal for dipping into that cream based tomato soup.

This is why stumbling across (OK stumbling isn't quite right, Google Maps helped and I won't eat breakfast on the strip) this gem of a greasy spoon.  I say hidden because it is off Decatur snuggled in behind a Taco Bell.

When I first walked in the door I was warmly greeted and took a seat at the counter, which is my favorite spot when dining alone.  My waitress' name was Renee who greeted me with hot coffee and a menu and suggested that I make sure to read the history of the joint on the back of the menu; which kicked off my sense of nostalgia because I love stuff like that.

I ordered my staple of eggs over easy, hash browns with white toast and the ham steak.  my order came out perfect (so many places overcook the eggs) and it was delicious.  In fact there was more food than I knew what to do with and this from a guy who is 6' 3"" and clocking in at 218 lbs.

If I had any room left, I would have had a slice of that pink double layer cake that was so high that it took two people to slice a piece and juggle it in one piece onto a plate for a customer.  I am still thinking about that cake 24 hours later.

So back to the history of the joint.  Lou's diner has changed hands a couple of times over the many decades and has remained in some way or fashion in the family of the original owners.  Until this last December.  This is when a new couple (I am so sorry I totally forgot their names, but they were so nice) just starting out their lives together bought the joint.

When a place I like changes hands, it usually suffers an identity crisis as the new owners try to put their own stamp on it and make it better.  THANKFULLY, this couple understand what Lou's is and who their customers are....  And have kept it the way it should be.

Otherwise the gelato was good, but they should've put more thought into how they structured the flower. You can choose up to three flavors per gelato flower.

Once we were near the bottom, he pushed pass me hard enough to CUT MY WRIST OPEN, I even still picked up his case to help him by. He got aggressive so I had to grab him by the arms to ensure that i wouldn't get hit in the face on my night out.  The bouncers separated us and I was refused to be let in the club.  

A night out at a club and casino such as Aria and such can be valued well over $1000.  I've purchased tables at other clubs such as XS, Tao and Light. This experience was worst I've ever had at a night club.  

I was also a national touring MC.  To think a staff member, DJ hire or employee can do that to a customer and get away with it is unprofessional.

I just checked and in October 2014 I wrote a 5 star review... little did I know that a few weeks later I would be treated so poorly. 

Towards the end of November I received a call from someone in the office. (Unfortunately, I don't remember her name) She explained that my Pap Smear had come back abnormal and that I needed to come in for another procedure (Colposcopy). When I asked how much the procedure was for she told me that with my not having met my insurance deductible for 2013 year it would be around $200. I explained that I did not have $200 at the current time and that I would like to wait until January to have this procedure if possible, so that I could save up the money and also so that it would go towards my deductible for the whole year (2014). She seemed aggravated by my reply and hastily informed me that I needed this procedure as I probably have cancer. And this is not something I should be putting off. I told her that I didn't have a choice and this is what I had to do at the moment. I informed her I would call back in January.
 
Fortunately, for me I've had a very similar situation happen to me when I was 20 years old, so I am aware that often doctor staff is not well versed in explaining procedures to patients. I was a little shocked that she would basically threaten me with cancer, but also tried to understand that she was hopefully just looking out for me. I'll be honest I found her to be incredibly rude and had considered writing this review at that point. The holidays got in the way I let it go. 
 
On Jan 15 when I called to discuss scheduling my appointment, I was pretty shocked to learn that the doctor had dropped me as a patient and that I would have to see if she would consider taking me back on. The girl was a lot nicer this phone call, but I was furious. I have been a patient for a few years and I was very upset to have to go through the horrible process of trying to find a new lady doctor. 
 
This is outrageous to me and honestly if this is how they run their business I don't want to be a patient. I feel like the doctor/staff only care about my getting cancer if I am able to schedule my appointments at their convenience. If this was such an important procedure for me to have, you would think the doctor herself would have contacted me.  
  
Personally, I think it is inappropriate for anyone other than the doctor to be discussing whether or not I may have cancer with me over the phone. That is a very scary thing to tell someone and I don't think it should be thrown around so lightly. Clearly the patients are not that important. 

It's a shame because I really liked Dr. Haydee Docasar and thought that I had found a permanent OBGYN. I'm really disappointed that I have to find a new one.",2/6/2014 17:53,35.99330849,-115.1214878,,NV,Henderson,89052,"Laundry Services, Dry Cleaning, Bespoke Clothing, Sewing & Alterations, Bridal, Local Services, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Daryas Costumes

SERVICE: Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. He made sure our food tasted great and our glasses were always full. Although the restaurant was busy and our server was waiting on several guests, he made an appearance every few minutes.

So we had someone clean it out but they couldn't get it out so they were going to use the camera and the hydrojet to clean it out. The salesman (supervisor) stated the good thing is any work we have done is already included in the hydrojet pricing. So they get it cleared now they find a crack in the pipe leading to the sewer line and we were charged almost $5000 to excavate a hole in our front yard and fix the broken pipe and hydrojet our line. Ridiculous we stopped work once we realized we were being overcharged so all they did was dig a hole in our front yard and hydrojet because we stopped it before we could get even ripped off even more. According to our bill which took 3 days to get we were charged $299 for the camera which shouldn't have been included because according to the supervisor it was already included with the hydrojet pricing $1400.

Is it even possible to transcend?

Maybe we should embrace the now. Maybe it's time to stop longing for Summer, 2008 and seize the day in Las Vegas.

That seems like an equation for a good time, right?  Well, it sounds good but Insert Coins still needs a little time to develop and get into sync.

The first night I went there I was definitely wow'd.  But that feeling subsided quickly due to the fact that the AC wasn't working correctly and the place had become a bit packed so the body heat alone was enough to raise the temp to an uncomfortable temperature.  Plus, a few of the games were out of order as well and I couldn't get my game on with the games I wanted to play.  Nonetheless, I sauntered on down to the bar to get a drink to cool off.  After weaving through the droves of dudes trying to hit on one of the few ladies in the room, I managed to get to the bar and order a drink.  I ordered a beer and a shot and the bartender took my credit card and ID and.. disappeared?  It seems that if you pay with a credit card (according to the bartender), you MUST keep a tab open and reach a $20 minimum.  Maybe I missed the sign that said that but I didn't get to see the bartender come around for about a half-hour so I was just stuck ""hanging out"" and waiting to close my check out.  While waiting, I took notice of the bar and the video games around it.  Aside from the LED lighting illuminating the bar, I love the fact that there are TVs positioned around the entire bar so people sitting and drinking can get in on the fun and play whatever games they had sitting in the PS3 in front of them.  Of course, you would have to wait a while to get in on the fun at the bar but good concept nonetheless.

Music was pretty good too.. I didn't catch the name of the female DJ that was spinning but she managed to get most of the club moving for a bit.  There was a dance floor in the back of Insert Coins in front of the DJ for dancing and that night nerds, clubbers, and tourists alike were using it for just that.

Insert coins has the right idea but needs a little more time to fall into place.  I thought the ""open tab"" $20 min thing wasn't too ridiculous but a little inconvenient just like the games that were out of order for the evening.  Drinks were a bit pricey for a downtown hangout but I ""pre-gamed"" before I cruised on in so it didn't hit me as bad.  I'd definitely like to return again when everything gets straightened out and maybe jump on those arcades I came to play on but didn't have the chance.",7/3/2011 20:50,36.0216185,-115.2779243,"8544 Blue Diamond Rd, Ste 135",NV,Las Vegas,89178,"Shopping, Vape Shops",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Vap O Rise Vape Shop

Haha The womens bathroom was pretty modern and very clean. The nicest and cleanest Ive seen in a sushi spot.  

The tapas came out quickly. But didnt care for the kalua pork spring rolls, the sauce for it was too sweet and runny. The calamari on the other hand was great. Nice, golden brown and crunchy, not greasy or chewy at all. The sauces were perfect as well. 

Sushi... they give way more rice than fish when you order nigiri...  Which I always feel, is how they try to get you full. But the yellowtail melts in your mouth, so that was good. The Unagi was great, not to saucy and a good portion. The other 2 rolls; Lisa Lisa & Lahaina Roll, were average in flavor, a little bland and they came out messy, the fish were nice and fresh, but still average. We also ordered the White Chocolate Macadamia Brownie, which was a huge disappointment. It was on top of a raspberry jelly thing, and that ruined everything. The raspberry jelly killed the flavor of ""white chocolate"" in itself. All you can taste was the jelly. Its a bad thing when the dessert isnt right in flavor. *sigh* Over all, I've had way better presentation and flavor for the same price, at many other places... So yeah.

Often times you see celebrities, the restaurants are decorated in over the top fashion. They have a tendency to take you somewhere far away from Vegas through the ambience, the food, the atmosphere.

Le Cirque is a small restaurant that is decorated like the finest circus big top I have ever seen.  They have a monster wine list with a french speaking, well experienced sommolier to match.

It is almost irrelevant in regards to what I had because when you are paying as much as my group paid for the bottles of wine and the food, the staff will do whatever is necessary so you leave satisfied.  My party of three left satisifed having tried a variety of meats with perfectly pair wines to match.

I would say that it is necessary to make reservations.  If you are on a date, don't look at the eye candy that are on the arms of other men.  If you are going to do that bring your own.

S4Gbn_NGFPg7d7kb6SiSlw,Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,Rv0UdhYw_UVIv4D2lc-qgg,4,5,2,4,"Came here for a late-ish dinner with some friends after we had found out about this place opening up from a mutual friend of ours on Facebook. Up until actual arrival to the location that we had noticed it had taken over Inyo's spot. rip Inyo. didnt even get to try their AYCE before they closed LOL who knows when they closed, and when news about this place was spread but if it wasn't for that mutual friend, we would have never known. Despite the ""delay"" in finding out about this place, we were ecstatic to hear about a Korean soup place opening up. Something that is essentially non-existant in Las Vegas. 

We had wondered if it was part of a chain/franchise-type of stores from LA or something but with little research, we had found out they were from Seoul O.o ?! ooh another place brought from Seoul ! yaaaaaassss ! standards for this place are now freakin high compared to the already high hopes we had for this restaurant

Interior layout hasnt changed much except maybe newly painted and new paintings with their restaurants mark on them. 

We had really hoped to find a good sullungtang place as well as gamjatang, galbitang, etc place in Vegas but aside from E-jo for a decent sullungtang, nothing else comes close in the city. Closest would be 4 hours away in LA. 

Upon arrival of 2 of us while 2 were still on the way, we were told by the waitress they had ran out of the first 3 items on their menu. With prior research before coming here, i had knew she was talking about the sullungtang.. SO SAD ! apparently they had sold out and the soup they were in the process of making was not strong enough and will not be served tonight. Note this is a little after 9pm, on a Friday evening. They are scheduled to close at midnight. Yeah they just opened 2 weeks ago so ill give them benefit of the doubt that they are still not used to the amount they need daily. 

Another item we wanted to try was the gamjatang, or otherwise known as the pork back-bone soup/hot pot. Two versions are available. ""Individual"" servings at $9.99 for the pork back-bone soup or the boneless pork, or the ""Hot Pot"" style at $28.99. 

We had ordered a bossam ($13.99 for mini, 28.99 for large) as well. We had asked if the hot pot was good enough for 4 people, and the waitress said it was enough for 4 with maybe an appetizer or another dish on the side. As mentioned previously, it was around 9-930pm and we were notified that they were running out of bossam and was suggested for the ""mini"" order instead. We added a kimchi dumpling with rice cake too. 

Things came out pretty fast. First the banchan. Homemade kimchi with tons of garlic, pickled daikon, japchae as well has individual bowls of a jalapeno/onion sauce thing with wasabi mixed into it. We never really figured out what this sauce thing was for so we kind of used it with the gamjatang and bossam meat. 

Soon after came the stove, and the gamjatang. Pretty good size. A little ""smaller"" than i had expected of a casserole size compared to previous experience with ""individual sizes"" at other restaurants who usually piled the bones up high till you cant fit anymore but was still a good amount. The casserole was topped with perilla leaves and apparently perilla seeds (totally had to google this to find out). Always wondering what that pile of stuff was on top. This is the first time where i've been given potatoes with my gamjatang (which was a great addition, since i didnt get rice). Broth tasted really nice. Not overpowering. Rich, slightly milky. My only ""complaint"" about this is they may make the bone pieces a bit smaller. Some pieces were a stretch of like 3-4 vertebrae which was hard for some people to move from casserole to their bowl/plate. 

Bossam (mini version) came with 12 slices of ""steamed"" pork belly with a mound of chinese chives mixed lightly with some spice, some pickled daikon, and slices of pickled daikon (versus the more ""Traditional ""pickled napa cabbage). Bossam was served with a side of samjang (fermented bean paste), saeujeot (fermented salted shrimp), sliced garlic and sliced jalapenos. Essentially pile everything on top of eachother and eat it all in one bite. What a mix of flavors, textures, and yumminess. Only complaint is maybe the pork belly was cooked a little too long? Or maybe not long enough. Slightly tough in some pieces. Better with the more fatty cuts. 

The kimchi dumpling with rice cake was $10.99, same price without rice cake. With rice cakes, there were 6 large kimchi dumplings in a thick soup with shredded beef, egg, and of course rice cake. The thick soup was nicely seasoned already. The egg adds a nice touch. The thickness of the soup reminds me of like... either hot n sour soup or egg drop soup. Kind of different but not bad.

Membership - if you are a local a membership is recommendable. It's a good place to visit on weekends where you don't have anything planned but still want to do something with the kids or family for an hour or two.

Displays and activities - there's tons to do. Different themes on every level, from water play to science to health education etc... There's also a designated section where they change the display periodically. They once had Thomas the Train which we loved. At our recent visit they have Clifford the BIG red Dog. There's also a toddler section.

Age Suitability - toddlers to 10... Or probably up to 12. My preteen still enjoys playing at the pirate ship, water play area and that middle section where kids can go up and down while exploring the exhibits (it's my least loved section only becoz my aging body couldn't keep up hahaha). My little one loves almost all of the areas and exhibits.

Rest area and Food/snacks - foe the most part there's lots of sitting areas for parents as they watch over their kids explore. The only thing I wish they have ia a snack/food place. They do have a separate eating area but there's not food for sale other than what's on the vending machine. Would be nice to grab a quick bite rest a bit and go back in again for more fun exploration.

Staff - there's ample of staff everywhere.. And EVERYONE i say EVERYONE is very friendly. I know they are required to since they will be dealing with kids. Still I appreciate the effort because no job is easy and I applaud this place and its amazing staff

Cleanliness - entire area and restrooms are well maintained. Of Course some displays can get icky. But that's expected when hundreds of little hands touches them everyday lol

First time here, I got kicked out for throwing up in the restroom (drank a bit too much, I know.) The lady escorted me and my friends out, but she said once I sobered up, I was able to reenter the club again. Yay! It was during MDW 2015 for David Guetta too.  

Second time was for Kaskade in December 2014. My friends and I were trying to go indoors, but apparently you need 3 stamps (people who bought tickets), we only got 2. Once we found that out, we were trying to leave the line, but the bouncers kept pushing us and other people. Not only that, they were cussing at us. Seriously uncalled for. 

Third time was for Zedd in January 2015. These were for the bouncers in the beginning. They took my friends ID because it wasn't her. Really? How is it not her when she showed them proof? They even threaten to call the police. Be Careful of the Asian bouncer -__-. Horrible to his own people. 

Other than the bouncers, everything else is good. Venue is awesome, plus ladies get complimentary drinks. Not only that, you can be in the pool if you want. I never got kicked out when I jumped in with my friends during MDW.

We made reservations for our first night in Vegas. We got here a little early for our reservation and hung out downstairs for a little bit. I checked out the butcher shop they had downstairs and they had some nice looking pieces of meat. It's super smart for them to have a butcher shop right down stairs, lets you know that their meat is super fresh. When everyone arrived we went up to our table. We were seated in the back away from most of the customers, it was much appreciated that we got our own little private area. We brought a bottle of wine and the host that seated us joked that it was a $100 corkage fee, it gave some of my relatives a heart attack, but then she told us she was just kidding around and said they didn't have a corkage fee. I don't think I've ever been anywhere that didn't have a corkage fee so that was gracious of them. I really liked the style of this place, it was fancy, but a little rustic. The room balanced itself out, nothing too over the top, except for maybe that huge chandelier in the center of it all, but hey this is Vegas. 

Our server, Ramone, was exceptionally helpful. He recommended that we all share their 42 ounce tomahawk because they slice it up and make it family style. I wanted to try the duck, but the rest of my family decided to share the steak so I went with it. We also ordered a few appetizers to start, they all sounded incredible. I picked the pork belly with slaw and the chile cauliflower. The rest of my family also ordered the carne asada bone marrow, grilled octopus and portobello fries. It didn't take too long for our appetizers, and they all came at the same time. We each got a small portion of every appetizer. The cauliflower wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be, it was actually more on the sweet side. We asked Ramone what made the dish sweet, he told us there were pieces of garlic that were caramelized in brown sugar. Even though the dish wasn't as spicy as I expected it to be, it was still wonderful. Those caramelized pieces of garlic were and unexpected delight. The cauliflower was roasted and had a nice bite to it. My Mom loved the cauliflower dish, it was her favorite. The pork belly was marinated in a savory soy sauce and served on top of cabbage slaw. The pork melted in my mouth and the slaw gave the dish a refreshing crunch. The carne asada bone marrow was really innovative and unique. I've never seen another bone marrow dish like it. The addition of the citrusy carne asada and red onions gave the bone marrow more than just one note. It really freshened up a normally rich and heavy dish. The octopus was grilled to perfection and the sauce was tangy and clean. Lastly the portobello fries, the dish that I thought I would like the least actually turned out to be my favorite. I'm not a big mushroom fan and I especially don't like portobello mushrooms, but I could eat these all day. They had an excellent crispy coating that was seasoned well with freshly chopped basil and parmesan cheese. I'm not sure what the sauce was, but it was thick, bright green and very addicting. I would come back just for that snack. Next came the salads, which I didn't order or try, but they all looked good. 

I did use the bathroom a couple times here and it's lovely, clean and has a lot of space. I liked the single couch they had in the front of the restroom, it gave the room a charming touch. I also noticed they had a balcony with seats. They had a good view of the elegant round about and other shops and restaurants. Next time I want to sit out there. 

Lastly our glorious steak came along with a couple of sides. The steak came with house made potato chips and stuffed mushroom. We also ordered the broccolini side. The steak was cooked medium rare, but it was more rare on the inside pieces. No one seemed to mind though because it was just melt in your mouth, meaty deliciousness. We also got some sauces with our steak. Everyone ordered separate sauces and we got them all free with our steak. The favorite was the red wine demi-glace. I soaked my steak in demi and got some thick and creamy horse radish sauce on the side. I also had a couple potato chips and a small serving of broccolini. The steak was unbeatable, it was obviously treated with love and care. The demi was like a gravy and the horseradish brought some zest. The chips were thin and shattered like glass in between your teeth. The broccolini had a nice bite. It was served with whole cloves of cooked, soft garlic and was seasoned with red pepper flakes which brought some spicy heat. I love broccolini and they did this vegetable right. Everything here was absolutely delicious. 

Not only was this place amazingly delicious, but the prices were low. The steak that everyone shared was just $100 and each appetizer was under $10.

I know it is terrible timing with the Ritz and casino closing but the Village shops and restaurants are separate and I think they are going to do their best to stick around.

The village is really charming and it borders the beautiful man-made lake.  Bernard's Bistro is right on the lake and the view from the patio is amazing.  Like most of the restaurants in the village, they allow dogs in the outdoor dining areas.  In Spring, I hope there will still be the free concerts at the Lake because Bernard's is the perfect place to watch them from.

I had lunch at Bernards and the quality and presentation of the food was perfection.  I had the lentil soup of the day and it was very flavorful.   I also had the vegetable crepes which was the best vegetarian dish I have ever had at a restaurant and I have tried A LOT.   The crepes were a large portion of spinach and artichoke hearts topped with a creamy cheesy roux sauce.  The lunch prices were very cheap - less than 9 dollars for the crepes and the sandwiches and entrees were all around $10-$15.  There was fantastic service with plenty of refills on my delicious iced tea.

The Marzuka bars (granola N raspberries) are yummy but may need to be cooked just a little bit longer.

My disappointment is with the Smores Bread -
 Dosen't Marshmallows,chocolate and graham crackers all mixed into a bread sound just sound delicious ? Well it did to me but man it didn't taste good to me or anyone at work. The concensus is that it tasted like wheat bread with mini chocolate chips in it. The lady also told me that she couldn't put this bread into the bread slicer because of all the marshmallows - boy that got me excited. Well, no one spotted or even tasted a marshmallow.

I love fresh bread and I'm happy that there is a place close to work that I can buy fresh bread from and just from Walmart or Vons. Great Harvest is not cheap but sure is tasty. Don't forget that they have a bread slicer  and a frequent buyer card.
 Just yesterday they had for sale green colored bread made to look like fingers with red nail polish and orange colored bread that looked just like a large spider - Very cute.....

First we didn't have enough menus at the table of approximately 10 we had to pass around the 4 menus that we shared. Second drinks took it's time to make it to our table no big deal good conversation held us over. Third after all orders were placed literally took over an hour to receive our orders I don't mind waiting for good food but after tasting the meal it seemed a disgrace to Mexican food in my opinion. Afterwards it it took time to receive the check and once the check came it was not separated through out the group which was an issue because the waiter asked ""it will be easier if we split the cost through out the check""  not big deal but difficult knowing people are paying cash and card. Waiter let's us know that it will take 15-30 min to split the check due to their system being down we have know worries due to good conversation. After that issues was handled and payments were made and brought back to the table the waiter handed me all the cards to give to who they belong to as if it's my job and not hers plus dome paid with cash and it took another 10 minutes to receive the change because of the other tables that she had to attend no big deal but after the change was received was the wrong amount given.

Beef Carpaccio $19: This was so good. The best Carpaccio I've ever had. I don't like capers, and most places have it on their Carpaccio but not here! The cheese was grated so I felt like I tasted more cheese compared to when it's shaved. The arugula was tossed in cheese and lemony goodness.

Bucatini Cacio E Pepe $21: This was also really good and I'd definitely get it again next time. The pasta was a little more tough than I'm used to, but it made for a nice texture. The serving was more on the light side in my opinion, hence me having room
for another plate of Carpaccio.

Beautiful lobby, gym is nice and I like that there's plenty of security to make you feel safe. I'm giving this 3 stars because for a luxury hotel like Trump tower there are some things that I noticed that you would find at a 3 star hotel. First, the bathrooms. Although it had a huge shower and awesome jacuzzi,  the rubber on the shower door to prevent leaks was falling off. They should have strict quality controls. Second, we requested a crib for my daughter and they brought my husband and I this horrible looking rollaway crib that you would see in an orphanage with scuff marks all over the bars and a super thin mattress for her to sleep on. They don't even have baby mattress covers for it. They just wrapped a huge sheet around it and tucked it under. That's a SIDS risk! My daughter hated that thing. I've been to Hilton, Westin and other Hotels which offer actual pack and plays. It's not like Trump tower can't afford it. We ended up having to buy a pack and play for my daughter.Third, Customer service wasn't terrible but it wasn't top notch.

The decor was nice, and the server was friendly and attentive. (Then again, we ended up being the only people in here). I ordered the Nabeyaki udon and a popcorn roll. The udon was quite good; chewy noodles and flavorful broth. However almost every other place I've had the popcorn roll, it's warm but this place prepared it cold, and the pieces of ""lobster"" were cold as well.

Mon Ami Gabi is located inside Paris hotel but their outside patio is right on the strip.  They are always busy so try to come at off times if you're planning to dine here for lunch or dinner.  I've only been here for lunch on the weekends but I'd definitely recommend this spot to anyone who's never been.

My boyfriend and I shared:
Onion Soup Au Gratin & Prime Steak Sandwich upon recommendation.

They also give you bread and butter to start off with which is always a plus in my book.
I also noticed they had a Bloody Mary Bar in the middle of the restaurant that I thought was interesting.  If I was a bigger Bloody Mary fan I would've been down to try it but perhaps next time.

The Onion Soup Au Gratin was a lot bigger than expected and boy was I glad!  Definitely one of the top French Onion soups I've ever had--the soup had a savory flavor with onions, bread and tons of melted cheese.  The warm bread they bring out to you while you wait, also pairs well with this soup.  Must get!

The Prime Steak Sandwich was amaaaaaazing.  I was so happy I went with this recommendation as it did not disappoint one bit! We asked for our steak to be medium rare and it came out with peppercorn mayo and tons of carmelized onions.  Everything complemented each other and each bite was better than the first.  The steak was so tender and juicy... and the buns they used were warm and soft.  The sandwich also came out with fries too which were good but nothing special.  I actually prefer my fries to be a bit more crispier.  

The service was excellent and there isn't really anything to complain about except I do wish the tables were a bit further apart from each other.  Maybe it's just me but it feels like all the tables are closely set to each other and a bit crammed.  The prices are a bit steep but then again, it is Vegas so it's expected.

The food is as good as it is beautiful. All of the Thai restaurants I have been to up to this point sort of blend together. Arawan stands out. The decor is very modern, the presentation of the food is Instagram worthy and the food doesn't give you that post-MSG hangover feel. 
Their food is light and flavors subtle. Also beautiful presentation does not= small, their portions are big! 

Chicken pad thai: Mild, medium, hot or no spice. My dad went with no spice and loved it. I would suggest going with mild. Pad thai doesn't taste like pad thai if it's not a little spicy! 
Beef yellow curry: My favorite out of the dishes we ordered. It really stood out and was different from previous curries I've had. It had a ton of meat in it! Too much that I couldn't finish it. 
Pineapple fried rice: Very, very subtle taste of pineapple. It was perfect. 

This was the first Thai restaurant that I've been to that gets the rice to curry portion right. Good job guys. I didn't end up with leftover curry and no rice like I normally do :) 
Will be back to try the dessert!...... In the winter when the AC is not a necessity. They have large party rooms with tatami mats in the back. The pictures make them look nicer than they did when I was there...
The outside of the restaurant is not fancy. You get a perfect view of a deserted parking lot, swingers club, discount dentist and raunchy costume store. This would be the perfect place to take your girlfriend on a surprise date with a blindfold. Take if off once you get inside ;)

Now, the food.. 

Wanted to try something we can't usually eat at home, so we saw this passing by and it sounded good on a cold day. Had a hard time choosing what to get but I stuck with the restaurant's ""recommended"" bowls. Forgot what it was called, but that's okay because I wouldn't recommend it anyways. 

It had various pork and beef along with a half egg and a LOT of veggies.. Seriously, the ratio was almost all veggies, very little Ramen, and a few pieces of meat. All that along with the broth was sooo bland, it was almost offensive. I ate it all because it was like $21, and I was still hungry. 

My girl felt the exact same way about her spicy shrimp bowl. All in all, 2 bowls and 2 pints of beer was $62 before tip. I know it's the strip but I couldn't help but fill ripped off. Steer clear from this place, check another place out.

FOOD: The WINNERS were the Vuelve a la Vida Campecham (shared as an appetizer by 4 of us), the Fajitas (#24), the Chips and Sala (served pre meal at all tables) and the Guacamole (must pay for this to be added, but worth it).

After we were seated we were greeted by our sever who unfortunately was about to leave for the day. She introduced Deanna as our new server while she made sure we had plenty to drink before she left. Deanna proceeded to take our food order and was very vocal when our friends ordered the crispy chicken sandwich with an extra order of fries. They told her that they were sharing the sandwich to which Deanna replied loudly ""that's it ? You're sharing a sandwich?"" She seemed irritated and it continued when my husband and I ordered the crusted chicken romano with a salad to share. She commented again ""you're sharing too?"" Then to cap it off when our friend's 5 year old told her father that she wasn't hungry she stated ""so she isn't eating anything!"" 

Honestly, I found her behavior apalling and I have no problem taking my business to Lucille's and/or Claim Jumpers which are both just across the street. The food here is good but I don't need to be shamed for sharing a dinner that is actually large enough for 3 people.

This location does have a drive thru for your convenience. The last two locations that I visited were more of an express site at a mall and at the airport.
So you can order your food like normal and they'll bring your food to your table. They don't give you a number stand thingy but they somehow know your order magically.

I had the Seafood Diavolo.  This was a mixture of clams, mussels, squid and possibly swordfish in a spicy tomato sauce.  It was ok, hit the spot; however, nothing I would ever order again.  For $30 there are better entrees to be had in The Venetian Hotel (simply put).  

Had some kind of lemon merengue desert which needed help.  Tasted more like a lemon mousse to me.

Had a really good bottle of wine, a Barolo that ran $90 a bottle.  Technically the wine was the high point of our meal.

Service was okay, nothing special.

I'm not sure what occupied this spot before, but it doesn't matter because P.F. Chang's fits in really well with the other upscale (but casual) restaurants that inhabit Town Square. 
I've been to this location a few times now and I'm always taken away by the overall ambiance, it's a lot different than all other P.F. Chang's I've been to--in a good way. It's colored with murals and has a fun industrial twist with all of the exposed brick. It's also a great spot to people-watch with the floor-to-ceiling windows. 
My favorite aspect of dining is happy hour. It's my life's mission to partake in at least two happy hours per week. P.F. Chang's has a great happy hour and they also have daily specials. I ordered the Blushing Geisha cocktail, which I enjoyed very much. It was refreshing and crisp--perfect for the impending summer. 
This time, we ordered vegetable spring rolls and crab rangoons for an appetizer. Both were crispy, tasty, and filling. We finished these fairly quickly. Our waiter took a while to reappear after we finished the appetizers. It interrupted the flow of the meal. 
As for my entree, I ordered the shrimp lo mein. It was pretty standard. There was a generous amount of shrimp in the dish which is always a plus. 
We ended the meal with the banana spring rolls. I'm a big fan of these, they're sweet and warm, they pair well with the pineapple coconut ice cream they're paired with. My only complaint about this dish is how challenging they can be to eat.

My family and I managed to grab one of the last few remaining reservations on a Saturday night. Walking into the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by the staff and asked for our reservation details. Looking around the restaurant, the decor and ambiance is upscale with a fresh, modern look. For an Italian place, it's actually very refreshing to see these modern finishes as opposed to the classic Italian designs. 

Our server was around to start with drink orders promptly and began to explain their food philosophy and house specials (they have a soup and pizza special every day). We started with some house bread as an app which was served with a plate of olive oil with balsamic already added. The house bread was well baked with the crunchy crust and soft inside as its supposed to be! Our server stopped by to take our order and was extremely knowledgeable about the menu (she knew the portion size of meat offerings in the dishes)! I placed an order for the Bolognese which is a house special while the family decided on the Chicken Parm and Strozzapreti. Speaking for the Bolognese, I have to say it was incredibly delicious and it would not be a stretch to say possibly the best in town! The tagliatelle pasta was fresh while the meat sauce was perfectly mixed all topped off with a right (at least, I think so) amount of cheese. In regards to the other dishes, from what I heard, they were well made, fresh, and delicious as well. Despite being full from the main courses, we convinced ourselves to place an order for two different desserts: a hazelnut torta and a tiramisu. Due to a small mishap, we also happened to get the strawberry tart for free! I decided to dig on the tiramisu and the torta. The chocolate mousse balls that topped the tiramisu really just set apart the dish from everything else and was exceptionally well balanced in terms of sweetness.",9/10/2018 1:18,36.21891,-115.253244,7324 W Cheyenne Ave,NV,Las Vegas,89129,"Shopping, Eyewear & Opticians, Optometrists, Health & Medical",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Professional Eye Care Center

I came in for my birthday with some friends from out of town. We came in for a late dinner and was taken care of with meticulous hospitality. 

To start we ordered the oysters rockafeller and the crab cake. The portion sizes are not large. It is just a taste. Both were sensational. They were running a special on an Australian bone in 30 ounce ribeye which is raised similar to wagyu. We got one of those and their regular ribeye off the menu to compare. The marbling and tenderness of the Australian definitely stood out. It warranted the price as well. The sides were a letdown though. The mushrooms in goat cheese and bone marrow were not outstanding. The latter was underwhelming in the fact that it was so sparse. There was hardly anything to scoop up. The garlic spread that accompany it was the highlight. The pairing was intended to cut the rich fattiness of the bone marrow. Instead I used it for the ribeyes with the same intention.

Now this is where it got crazy. As the servers heard my friends wish me a happy birthday John G. prepared for a tour of the restaurant. After that we had to try some desserts. We got the churros with three different dipping sauces; strawberry, chocolate, and dulce de leche. It was good on its own or with the last sauce. The lava cake is JG's specialty. Apparently he came up with this signature dessert. It was the perfect portion. I could not see eating anything bigger. The strawberry rhubarb cobbler with pistachio ice cream is out of this world. The lattice work on top is gorgeous and every component meshed together well. Then there was the caramel sundae with the best caramel corn. The popcorn is served warm and it contrasts so well to the cold ice cream. I was on a sugar high and loving it.

Yonaka serves small Japanese plates with gorgeous presentations. The only issue with this is that each plate is so good you want 5 more.

Appetizers:

- Crispy Brussels Sprouts
I love Brussels sprouts so I really enjoyed, no strong flavor added possibly just salt and pepper. Most likely roasted to get the crispness

- Karaage
Little pieces of fried chicken, simple and flavorful, came out nice and hot

Sashimi:

- Suika Sakana
Tuna paired with watermelon and jalape√±o. Interesting mix of flavors but it was unique and delicious, topped with mint and cilantro

- Sake Orenji
Salmon doused in a tangy fruity dressing and served with mandarin oranges 

- Salmon Belly
No other salmon belly compares. Literally dissolves in your mouth. You can taste how fresh it is!

- Seared Sea Scallops
The best scallops I've ever had. They were cooked and seasoned perfectly; not undercooked or overcooked which is very common... I could eat this all day!

First of all, this place is small - we're talking seating for less than 50 people, give or take a few. I had read that there was usually a wait due to the popularity of the place and the lack of seating, but luckily for us, we were seated immediately when we arrived at 9:30 on a Tuesday morning. 

We ordered: 

Country fried steak: I almost always order country fried steak when it's on a menu, and this one was one of the better ones I've had in Vegas. It was really tender, and the outside was nicely seasoned. I also loved the fact that it came with country gravy with breakfast sausage in it - it was yummy and tasted like it was homemade.

Eggs: My eggs were over-easy, and they were cooked perfectly; no runny whites, only runny yolks, just how I like them. Hubby had scrambled eggs, and they were nice and fluffy.

Potatoes: I had the hash browns and Hubby had the seasoned potatoes. The potatoes were crispy and didn't require any salt, but were pretty average.

Sourdough toast: I don't know how many times I've ordered sourdough toast only to be disappointed. That wasn't the case this time - this is the real deal - not that imitation white bread posing as sourdough.

Corned beef hash: This was the canned version, which was disappointing. If there's one thing on a breakfast menu that most people expect to be homemade, it's corned beef hash. 

Red velvet pancakes: Hubby was nice enough to offer me one bite, and boy, was it delicious! It's the perfect balance of the red velvet flavor in a fluffy pancake. It came with whipped cream, chocolate crumbles and... wait for it... cream cheese syrup! I wanted another bite, but Hubby gave me that ""I love you, but don't even think about touching my pancakes or I will seriously stab you with my fork"" look. Yeah, I think he liked the pancakes. ;)

Up the escalator you find a very unique, nice restaurant, quiet from the hustle and bustle of the casino. We got there late and were seated immediately.  The menu, which we looked at prior to our arrival, is basic hamburger and fries type stuff and other assorted food of that ilk.  Beware....the portions are Godzilla sized.  You can easily split a burger with a friend.  The hamburger meat outside the bun was as much as was in the bun.  Our server was very nice, fun, and attentive.  The food tasted fresh.  I had the hamburger which had fried mashed potatoes between the meat, cheese, two large patties, lettuce, onion, and tomato.  I could hardly open my mouth big enough to take a bite.  I could not finish it.  The fries were just OK....just my personal preference.  They were a little brown for my taste...I kinda like to see them golden (just me) It's open 24/7 and definitely a place to try at least once!  Put it on the bucket list.

On the first day of vacation in Sin City, I mentioned to my other half, lets go to Luke's Lobster, but he wanted Asian food,  
Next day, I mentioned, lets go to Luke's Lobster, no luck again and again, up until the last day of my Vegas vacation, I asked again, and then my wish came true. I was super Excited and Happy!! 

The last time I had lobster roll and clam chowder this awesome, was in Seattle's Pike Place.  

Luke's Lobster is located in front of the Fashion Show Mall. Don't look for a restaurant type of place like I did. Its a cute food stand right in front of the Mall. If you are headed straight to Luke's Lobster like me, it is going to be a walk from the parking lot. I think the closest to Lukes is parking near Macy's. After looking at directory, it still took us awhile to get to Luke's Lobster, can you tell I really want to have my Lobster roll badly?!

When I finally made it to Luke's Lobster, I was SO Happy, I've been waiting since January/2017!! This is such a cute place, there is a cute dining area in the back of the shop with 5 tables. Enjoy your food there and you can listen to the outside music from the Fashion Show Mall. It took me awhile to finally decide, the staff was very friendly and really gave me great suggestions and answered all of my questions. The menu is short and simple. One of the great suggestion by staff was to get the trio.  

The only thing I regret during my visit was not having a feast, since we already had a big lunch  and about to have buffet dinner, this visit was just late afternoon snack. We ordered the clam chowder and lobster roll & paid 5.oo more to make it a combo with drinks and chips. Oh my goodness!! What we just had went so great together and WOW, the lobster roll  was so delicious, (lobster so fresh & juicy from Maine, seasoned just right, the rolls are filled with tons of lobster). This was the best Lobster Roll I ever had. I could taste the difference from all the lobster rolls that I've eaten, nothing comes close to Luke's. The clam chowder was very tasty also. The drinks got were organic lemon lime from Maine, which was so perfect. 

After our meals, I was one happy wife, thanks so much to my other half for taking me. 

Over-all, it was worth waiting for, worth every penny spent at Luke's, and I wish I visited more than once during my vacation. My other half enjoyed his meal too!! Now even after typing this review I am missing Luke's Lobster badly. - for now, I'll just have to live by the wonderful memories thru my photo until I visit Sin City again. 

I totally recommend Luke's Lobster!!

Their menu was extensive and I REALLY wanted to try their waffles or french toast, but ended up ordering their chicken fried steak. I had my choice between potato dishes (hash browns, sweet potato fries, potato salad or regular french fries) and bread dishes (regular toast, English muffin or their signature pot o' bread). Once I received my plate and ate, the meal was no better than what I could get at my local Denny's.

I was impressed with their homey atmosphere, the smell of roasting coffee, cooking food and all around enthusiastic attitude. If anything, I would go back just to be coddled and given all the attention I deserve from the waiters and waitresses eager to serve me.

Though my first time wasn't brilliant, I will be sure to order something from their original stash instead of typical breakfast fair.

When we picked her up, got home, after about an hour she started coughing or hacking. We let it pass, thinking it's just allergies or hairball. The next day, same thing but more frequent. I called Buffalo Springs since we had a feeling she got kennel cough from when she was boarded. We were told to bring her in. I asked if there would be a charge since she got sick while in their care. The receptionist said no they'll give her a check up and meds if needed. 
So we take the pup, she was given meds for kennel cough and respiratory problems she incurred. Again, my bf asked the vet/vet tech who examined our pup, ""there's no charge for this, right""? She said no since pup got the illness at their facility. So we left. 
2 weeks passed, meds didn't work. Took pup to another animal hospital, after about 4 days, no more hacking. After a couple of months we got a bill from Buffalo Springs for the medicines they gave our pup. It says if the bill isn't paid it will go to collections. We were surprised because we were told no charge at all! When we called them about the bill they said there is no charge for the exam, but we need to pay for the meds. Why didn't they tell us that in the first place?

af7emFTUeoKen3IQtoo_Cw,6BG-geUq96Q5j_sbG0fqlQ,Sm2k1ijcnK17Ro5paN2_qQ,1,5,0,1,"I hate to give a poor review but this place left me no choice. Had I noticed the reviews under the previously named pizzeria Grand Italia I wouldn't have ordered...2 star avg for 60 reviews. They obviously shut down under that name and rebranded under Grand Pizza, but as you can see by my receipt it's still the same place.
I have previously worked in the pizza/restaurant business for many years and if I was the owner I would truly be ashamed to put out the product that they sent me. I have to question who actually makes the product here and whether the owner is even on site and aware of the shoddy product being served. I truly don't understand the 4 and 5 star reviews on here. I imagine that could either be explained away by people having ordered other menu items or people not really knowing quality pizza (I mean Domino's and Papa John's are multi-million dollar businesses, right?) 
Many other reviews don't even touch upon the quality or taste of the food, but rave about price for the discounted pick-up pizza special, or friendly service and staff. I don't care how nice or cheap you are if I'm getting inedible product. And if the best you can say is the pie was $7.95 well that's not saying a lot is it? I don't want to come here for wings or burgers or chicken sandwiches, salads or quesadillas. I want pizza and calzone! 
My bill with delivery, tax and tip came to around $48 dollars and was not worth even 1/4 of that. I ordered a Sicilian 4 topping pie for $21, a medium two topping Calzone for $15 and a Cannoli for $4 bucks or so. Not one of these items was halfway good.
Let's begin with the pizza. It had 8 square slices and each one was ridiculously heavy... And it was easy to tell why... It mostly consisted of super dense uncooked raw dough. Sicilian pizza should be thick but the dough should be light and airy. Because we were hungry we picked off the toppings and the edge crust, put the crust in the oven until it was crisp, and ate that with the toppings. The only positive here was that the cheese and toppings seemed like quality product. 
The Calzone was truly awful. A Calzone should be a thin crusted popover stuffed 80-85% with ricotta cheese and the rest with mozzarella and your choice of topping. What I received was a soft mushy doughy I-don't-know-what that had a paper thin layer of ricotta as if one spread it like peanut butter in a sandwich. The layer didn't even extend closely to the outer edges of the ""calzone"" so 50% of your bites had no cheese. And this was $15. I've had 50x better calzone here in Vegas for half the price! I wouldn't be surprised if they used a 1/4 cup of ricotta for the entire 16"" calzone. Very very sad and disappointed. It had more mozzarella and sausage/ham than ricotta. Not the way it's supposed to be done, boys. Did I mention the dough was thick, soft, and airy, like a dough sponge and not crisp at all? 
Then came the cannoli...Oy! I picked it up and I already knew what was wrong. It weighed almost nothing... Meaning no filling. It was probably 6-7"" long but had filling extending 1-1.5"" on both sides leaving the entire middle empty. What filling was there tasted old as if it was sitting for a while. The shell tasted stale and was hard. Not worth $1 let alone $4.
I must mention I'm from NYC and so I have a high standard for pizza, calzone and Italian food. So living here in LV I tend to give places a break... I'm aware it's not NY. That said, I've had several experiences with pizzerias here that I'd put up against some NY pizzerias in a heartbeat. I'd have rather had DiGiorno and Hot Pockets. 
For the amount of money I threw away ordering from this place I could've gotten a much better meal elsewhere without having to pick apart my food. 
Not only did I lose $50 I also lost respect for myself in that I didn't call them and ask immediately for a refund! Like I said, as someone who has cooked for a living and worked in pizzerias I take a lot of pride in what I send my guests. If I wouldn't eat it, it doesn't leave the kitchen. If my guests are unhappy I take it very personally. I hope the manager and/or owner here does as well.",2/4/2017 0:08,36.0680153,-115.0699059,"693 N Valle Verde Dr, Ste 5",NV,Henderson,89014,"Shoe Stores, Sports Wear, Fashion, Dance Wear, Sporting Goods, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,The Dancer's Closet

Then saw a an EIS cream sign right outside. The sign triggered my memory and I knew I had bookmarked the place and had been wanting to try it out, but just never knew where it was. In other words, IT WAS MEANT TO BE! 

My friends and I walked into such a beautifully lit and decorated ice cream shop- it was definitely a CHILD'S DREAM, as well as 3 ADULTS' DREAM. lol. Upon walking in, we were greeted by a nice lady. She offered us samples of any we wanted to try, and I was not disappointed once! The ice cream was perfect and there are various flavors to choose from, good for the entire family!!

We got the mini ice cream cone sampler, which comes with 9 mini cones all for $10! An ice cream addict's dream come true!

The gazillionaire was pretty funny but his side kick wasn't funny at all. I think she should be changed to a character that you want to hate a little less. I didnt think she was funny at all and frankly detracted from the show. Not the actress, just the character she played. Her jokes were like the cheapest, most low form of comedy where you chuckle bc your uncomfortable or bc the people around you are laughing.

I also think I would have enjoyed it more if I hadnt seen zumanity the night before which has the luxury of being in its own custom designed theater with all of the lights and special effects of cirque. It was like Ceasar's wanted their own zumanity but didnt have room so they popped up a tent outside... which by the way is where this is. Then hired interesting talent that were ok being naked and had  lucid absinthe sponsor even though it has nothing to do with the show. 

I know a lot of ppl enjoyed the show and like I said the ""acts"" were really good circus type stuff. 

Some tips- If you buy a premium seat it comes with a split of champagne per person at the ONE bar. Yeah, that one incredibly long line for everyone... except they dont tell you or advertise that premium seat holders have their own entrance through the green telephone booth with their own bar. Ask someone where it is. AND CEASARS! IF YOURE READING THIS PUT UP A DANG SIGN! It is so annoying to wait in line 45 min and then find out you had your own personal entrance bc they turn you away at the general admission line.

Also be prepared to not go to the restroom the entire time you are there. 90 MIN.

Usually I eat at Indian restaurants and occasionally I have some Thai curry but this was no match for either. 

We started with appetizers, of course. Their special fried oysters(5$) and some seaweed salad(2.50$) 
The oysters were AMAZING! The sauce that it comes with just melts in your mouth. Definitely top 5 oysters I've ever had. The seaweed salad was pretty standard, it was delicious but not a MUST-HAVE. 

I checked in on Yelp for their free side of potato salad and never received it but we were already getting full from the appetizers so we wouldn't have been able to enjoy it fully. 

I ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry (11$) and the portion was humongous! It came with a side salad, and miso soup. The soup was fantastic. Finally, a soup that tasted fresh and not frozen from a bag! 
The salad on the other hand had barely a sprinkle of any sort of dressing. That's something that needs to be changed. 

The curry itself is a must have and I can't want to try the rest of the items on their menu! 

Last but certainly not least. The Green Tea Cheesecake! It was a small portion for 5$ but the cheesecake was so delicious I didn't care about the price. It comes with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream as well.

She was right, but she never knew about Sweet Addiction.  My mid-day meal was an ice cream sandwich made with two fresh cookies and a nice amount of ice cream.  It makes absolute nutritional sense to me!

On entering the store, I'm sure I had that ""deer in the headlights"" look.  One of the staff  immediately asked me if it was my first time there.  Answering in the affirmative, she explained what they sell and how it's served.  She was wonderful, and I felt like a long time valued customer almost from the get go.  That's good customer service for a place that's only been opened two weeks.

After the explanation, I ordered a cookie sandwich with chocolate malted crunch ice cream.  I opted to get two of the same cookies rather than mix.  I need to save that option for my next visit.  I chose the chocolate brownie cookie.  These cookies are marvelous.  It's a soft brownie in the shape of a cookie with a rich, chocolatey taste.  

The cookie sandwich is served in a styrofoam bowl, so if you're a drip like me, they go into the bowl and not on the table or your napkin or worse--your pants.  Even so, I still had chocolate fingers and I probably had some chocolate in my beard.  They have bathrooms so you can wash off the excess you can't lick off--well not politely anyway.

I spoke with the owner about hiking and his beginning mountain biking and I felt like I was talking with people I already knew.  It's a very comfortable, easy place to go.  And, it certainly is addictive.  I may have to switch now and then the Wallyworld I go to so as not to be tempted to make this a weekly stop.  I'll have to hike extra this week to work off this nutritious mid-day meal.  Thanks, mom!  And, thanks to the Yelpers that discovered this place and let me in on it.  I'm glad they didn't keep it a secret.

Happy mountain biking and hiking (for the ladies of the store)!",7/31/2012 21:23,36.05336867,-115.2414764,7420 S Rainbow Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89139,"Community Service/Non-Profit, Shopping, Thrift Stores, Donation Center, Used, Vintage & Consignment, Discount Store, Fashion, Local Services",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Goodwill Retail Store and Donation Center

I love sushi, I bow to you. I worship at your delicious menu and your fantastic service, and your overall Zagat awesomeness. 

Sit at wooden tables and be served by wonderful ladies in kimonos equip with the shoes and all. They hand you a quick sushi list where you can check off any one of the nearly 100 sushi options they have. Don't get confused, the sushi is not listed in the folding menu, but on a stand at the end of the table. Names will make you giggle in front of your parents as you ask for ""I love my ass"" and ""Tastes like my x-girlfriend"". In fact, I sometimes have to stray from the awkward named ones because I'm almost always at sushi joints with my folks when back home. I resolved on Burning My Stomach ( which is probably sexual..somehow) and the Banzai Roll. The banzai roll is a delicious sweeter roll with teriyaki sauce wrapped in rice paper. 

What really opened me up was the Burning My Stomach.  Really spicy crab meat dumped on more spicy crab and shrimp inside a roll surrounded by a thick layer of sashmi cut tuna. The flavor in this is insane. It's too big to eat in one bite, but maybe that's how you like it. 

My mouth was burning so much afterward that water just made the temperature decrease from 200F to 199 F. Had to settle on a nice plum wine ice cream to give myself a break. It was perfectly sweet and tart just at the last minute that I had to eat the entire bowl, good thing I'm starting that ""diet"" next year.

--------------------------------------------------------

My last two visits with friends (when I go out I usually do so when friends are in town) have devastated my once-fond memories of the Golden Tiki.

Next to Last Visit: During the day with a fellow gambler. We each dropped $200 on the machines. Two others joined us, one dropped more money in. Comped drinks = 0. Bartender was not friendly, but at least the drinks were, which leads to:

The last visit - a friend of mine came in from Phoenix for an event last month, and he came in a day early. That night (Wed) we went to the GT on empty stomachs - I ordered a Navy Grogg and he ordered a mind eraser. After ~10-15 min of nursing (and then finishing) our drinks both were still absolutely full - of crushed ice. And, despite these drinks on empty stomachs neither of us had nary a buzz.

After a Gut-Filler @In-N-Out, we went to Franks. As it was called in a review response by a manager/owner ""a dive"" I'm guessing that that's the kind of Tiki bar that I need to go to get a drink that's more adult beverage than icee. 1 drink = good buzz on food-laden stomach, and then we got comped a couple of shots for playing a LOT LESS Video Poker. In retrospect we maybe shouldn't have taken them because we were buzzed, but we did. Probably because we were buzzed.

Y, maybe I'll show up on a rare Thursday to watch The Sharps (and drink beer), but for any other of my occasional drinking outings, I'll not go here.

The issue here was the main courses.  They simply weren't very good.  We both ordered our steaks (one rib-eye and one filet mignon) medium rare, and one came out rare (rib-eye) and one came out beyond well-done.  Even at rare, the meat was tough somehow.  

The sides were very good, but small.  The potatoes with the filet were fried bits of dough - no taste outside of oils and minimal starch.

 More than ever stand firm in my rating. 
 Pretty much everyone I know that has visited this restaurant either LOVES it or, like me, doesn't get what's to love about it.
 First, credit where it's due- fast, efficient, food comes out accurately and promptly and there's a LOT of it. Our party had almost 20 and was handled seamlessly. 
 Now the food- if you want an enormous heaping platter of completely tasteless breakfast fare- look no further. You have found just the place!
 The lack of taste is uniformed pretty much regardless of what you order, I've sampled my family's food on previous visit and stole a bite off co-worker's plate. The kitchen is very conservative with flavor and seasoning- not sure if they simply expect that patrons will douse everything with hot sauce and go to town with salt shaker, but there you have it. 
 Stuck to poached eggs, as I saw no reason to load up on bland calories. 
 You are really better off either cracking eggs into a skillet in your own kitchen or hitting up one of the myriad of coffee shops in this city.",9/27/2015 15:03,36.13841517,-115.0670849,2775 S Nellis Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89121,"Head Shops, Tobacco Shops, Vape Shops, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Nellis smoke shop

But after finally going, all I gotta say is meh.  I really don't think it lives up to the hype.  

1) This place is huuuugee, this place definitely is not as cramped like your typical Vegas club. Bonus points for having plenty of places of us non VIP folks to sit.  It's refreshing to actually have a club in Vegas that has seating without having to drop a grip load on bottles.   

2) Drinks are your average Vegas prices, so no real complaints or issues there.

3) Lines do move as fast as everyone says it does, so + points for them on that one too.

4) Everyone pays, even girls.  To me that's a big wow, that's surprising for a Vegas club.

So with all these pluses why 3 stars?  Plain and simple, the music.  I'm not really a big trance/house/techno guy, so I wasn't feelin' the music at all.

I HIGHLY Recommend NOT making an appt with this office. My review is merely factual in nature to express my experience and SUB STANDARD QUALITY of Care.

I came in as a cash patient to get an exam to look at a mole. I previously expressed my worry and that ALL Cancers run in my family. 
I was brought back for the exam. The assistant put me in a room and left to get DR TRENT. I was not asked why I'm there. What my concerns were or even go get in a gown so the doctor could perform a PROPER and THOROUGH Examination. 

Dr Trent arrived, it was clear he had no idea why I was there or my Chief Concern... Nor had even reviewed my chart or the fact that cancer runs in my family and I felt very anxious and scared about my skin. That I wanted a full and thorough exam! 

He proceeded to try to look at the mole √ºnder my armpit. He could not see it because I had my scrub top on. I said this is ridiculous. I need to remove my scrub top. He said okay. And stood there waiting! THERE WAS NO Chaperone present! I felt Extremely uncomfortable!!!! Then he proceeded to look and say it was nothing. I asked, are you going to use magnification to be sure? He said no we don't do that. I said I came in for a full exam. He said where are the others? (As I am trying to pull up my pant leg for him to look).

I was APPALLED at the Lack of Professionalism! And poor quality of care! He should be ashamed of himself! I felt like just a number.

That isn't even the worst part! I leave.. Call them back and express all this to the front desk girl. She said I can come back in to see him again. I said I don't want to see DR Trent again! Can I go somewhere else? I was told he was the only doctor.

... I called back 2 months later and talked to Kasey. She was very kind on the phone and listened to my concerns. I expressed all this again and told her I expect that they will make this right. She said she would send this to the proper channels. 
... I HEARD NOTHiNg BACK!!!! Then I called June 12 ( another 2 months later!) and talked to Kasey Again. She said she hadn't yet heard from the ""upper management"" . I expressed that AS A PROVIDER MYSELF I understand the Quality of care! And what is expected! I told her your office and dermatologist Dr.Trent should be ashamed! I told her that the Las Vegas Valley and they being Specialists should be Rendering Proper Care!!!!! I demanded the number to Marissa who is the ""upper management"" that has been DISREGARDING MY CONCERNS Along with Dr.Trent! 

I would NEVER render Sub-Standard care to my patients! The Patient deserves way better.

Take your money and go elsewhere. Dr.Trent could have called me. The front could have called me... The manager could have called me. But no one did.

Monday night I was here for a bachelor party, I just wanted to make sure my friend had a good time before he got hitched. I haven't been to a strip club in almost 5 years, unfortunately I broke that record when I went to Sapphire. 

Being a Monday night there seemed to be a lot of single mothers with funky lingerie that is obviously designed to hide s_____ marks and most did not look appealing but there were still a couple hot girls. 

Of course the [censored by yelp] _____ looking ones ones need to be more aggressive and they try to get a lap dance, they'll chit chat on your lap until you're ready to buy. So this older one sits on my lap and after some conversation I tell her ""maybe later"" as a nice way of saying NO. If you're going to pay $20 for a lap dance at least get it from one that is worth it. This way she's not wasting her time trying to convince me. She didn't move, so I said it again incase she didn't hear it the first time (the club is blasting music and you have to yell into someones ear to talk). She immediately cops this huge attitude, taunts me and ends it with ""that's what I thought"". I ignore her and look away, could have gone off on her but [censored by yelp- sorry they don't let me write the details]

We ended up coming back the next day to try an even harder puzzle because we couldn't stop talking about the fun we had. 

Special mention to LEXI and CHEYENNE for being such great hosts. 

They were able to guide us when we called for help, they nudged us when we needed it and were super excited for us from beginning to end.

The place itself is spotless, modern, has free refreshments afterwards and lots of different choices and levels for games.

When I pulled up to enter no one acknowledged my present I waited in my car for 10 minutes till finally someone not the three people already out there finally came out and waved me in. I got the 49.99 car plan with the super interior cleaning. The driver told me it would be an 1 hour and15 minutes for the cleaning. So I patiently waited in the waiting area. He called me for my car. So I got in and pulled into the shell gas station to pump gas. My passanger seat was pulled up all the way up which was odd because it was not like that before. When I pulled the seat back I revealed a circle of dried up frosting on my carpet that was there before. The man had vacuumed the carpet around the stail and hid the stain by pulling the se. Up. I am not happy at all that was the reason I wanted to get my interior cleaned I made sure to ask him for a plan to clean the floors and he suggested this one. As I pulled out of the gas station a banging noice had started to occur as my wheels rotated. The noise subsided and I no longer hear it. And as well as I noticed while pulling out that there where hand prints on my windshield that was apparent that the inside of my windshield was not cleaned at all. As well as an oilly substance was left all over my front console ie my radio and thermostat. This has been far my worst car cleaning.,3/16/2013 4:00,36.095563,-115.175836,3900 S Las Vegas Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89119,"Shopping, Jewelry",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Lilly Rocket

Went up and the girl said it would be a minute till we get seated. Ok fine. Waited another 10mins while I see people that checked in after me got seated. Ok what's wrong with this picture? I went up again to ask the hostess if our table and she said yeah your table is being cleaned. I looked around and saw no one cleaning a table besides the fact that I saw at least 2-3 tables opened and already cleaned. Again I told the girl well u said that 10mins ago that it'll be a min till we get seated. after I said that THEN that's when all of a sudden our table was ready. Weird. 
2- they discontinued the fried squid legs and agedashi tofu. Those were my favorite appetizers (well me and the rest of my party)!Minus a star for that as well. Why did they delete those two items? Please bring them back otherwise they'll for sure lose a loyal customer. Now that only brings 4things for their appetizer and their ""seasonal"" ones that they never seem to have because I've been coming here at least once a month and they never seem to always have them.

Once you figure out how to get into the underground parking areas, I've always been able to find a space without hassle. Inside the mall has a nice mix of shops from stuff found in any mall across America all the way up to Tiffany, Bloomingdales, a really good Nordstrom's, and yes even that British export Topshop. And while some dislike the floor layout, I like how it makes you explore the place. You're not like a cow walking down the path blindly following the herd...you gotta look around, you gotta know where you're going...and as you're looking around you can find some great shops. 

Food wise they have a wide mix from Auntie Anne's pretzels to a Chipotle to even Grimaldi's pizza. Pretty much any pricepoint you can ask for is covered here. 

From a people watching perspective, Fashion Show is some of Las Vegas's best street theater in action. On my last trip I saw everything from locals all the way to some D-List celebrity with a camera crew in tow filming his every move. You literally have no idea what your going to see if you're there in the evening. But the mall does offer some chances to feel uncomfortable. Wear street clothes or business casual dress and go into some of the higher end stores and it's easy to get that I don't really belong here feeling...until you say screw that and laugh at the thought of someone paying out the nose for some of the crap they're selling. 

If I want to shop I go in the evening. If I need to get in, get out and get on with my life I go during the weekdays, and the earlier the better.

So we pick her next favorite cuisine, Thai.  Having missed out on Pam Real Thai the last time out, I take this opportunity to make this our destination.  Walking in, it's peculiar that we are the only party there.  Turns out, we were the only party here throughout our dinner...

The interior has a clean and neat, if not exactly trendy, decor that give it a splash of style.  The server is pleasant, and as expected with us being the only guests, appropriately attentive.  Overall we were very pleased with the ambiance.  To the food that I was really looking forward to, especially given the experience the other day.

We ordered a large Tom Kha soup, spicy pineapple fried rice, shrimp pad thai, and crispy pork with chinese broccoli.  

Tom Kha soup - tasty but too salty and not spicy enough.  Was more a fan of the reddish tint to the soup, here it is white.

Fried Rice - good, fiery taste but again not spicy enough.  Also salty.

Pad Thai - Again salty but pretty good.  Has an usually tangy taste which was just okay for me, others liked  it.

Crispy Pork - Not bad, no gamey taste which is good, but taste-wise nothing spectacular.

So a bit disappointed because the food overall is a decidedly 3-star affair, but the service and the more modern ambiance gets a 1/2 star upgrade.  So really a 3.5 star experience, but the fact that it can't fully be appreciated due to the emptiness it will have to settle for a 3.

I was hoping this would be the place I would order for my wedding too.  Alas, it is not.  I went online and tried finding good reviews for specialty cakes.  After much online research, it was between this place and one other.  Needless to say, I chose wrong.  

The cake I ordered had one major flaw, the color was completely wrong, which really changed the look of the cake.  The picture I provided was clearly pink, the color they used was WHITE.  They tried to tell me it was BLUSH PINK.  It looked WHITE.  I was hoping that the taste of the cake would make up for it, but it did not.  The frosting was good, but the actual cake part was not something that went over well at the party.  Super disappointed for the amount of money we paid for it.  I should mention that this place is pricey, which wouldn't have been an issue if the cake was any good.  

She literally tried to tell me that they did their best to match the color.  She tried to sell me it as pink.  I might have felt better about it if they would have called me ahead of time and said they can't match the pink, and offered a discount or something.  But I got there the day before the party, and they tried to ignore the fact that the color was WHITE.  I told them I was unhappy.  The person there asked what I would like for them to do.  Picking up the cake the night before the party, that started at 11am the next morning, I didn't want them to do anything.  I was just hoping that it would taste good.

But instead of being out and going buck-wild hung-lo style all over town, I've decided to share my experience at L'Atelier with my fellow yelpers (woo for you!).

First off, I dig the decor.  Very dark and chic, trendy, cool I think best describes it.  However, I don't like the sushi themed tables where you are forced to sit at a bar.  Although it is comfortable, it's not very good for intimate conversations or playing footsie for that matter.

Second, the food was good, not great.  I'm sorry but if some of you think that's the best tasting menu you've ever had, then you've been to all the wrong restaurants.  The food is good, but the best dish has to be the cocotte of egg with parsley puree, mushroom foam and sauteed chantrelles.  The quail is also a hit, it's served with a soy/chicken demi sauce (or at least that's what I think it tastes like), truffled mashed potatoes, (Joel Robuchon is known for his potatoes, it's one of his signature dishes and is basically your basic pommes puree with an equal amount of french butter added to it.  It's awesome but sickeningly fatty.) and a micro green salad with truffle vinaigrette. Other good dishes include:

Poached kumamoto oysters poached in butter, lemon, chives and sea salt.

Strawberry milkshake with strawberry sherbet, fresh strawberries and pistachio crisps.

Not so good were the:

Assortment of ice creams and sherbets that the waiter failed to identify.

The grilled Santa Barbara Prawns with Romesco Sauce (just didn't feel like it was a real romesco, imho).

and

The scallop carpaccio with lemon marmalade (the marmalade was great), soy, evo, and pepper.

So you ask, 'Hung, if the food was good why only 3 stars?'.  Well if you'd just wait a minute, I'd tell you.

Service.
Service.
Service.

The bill came up to be about 300 dollars for the two of us, one cocktail and a water.  With that being said, service should have been to par with that of a true french restaurant.  The waiters should not have been snobby, unprofessional, unenthusiastic, cold or answered our questions with short remarks.

The conclusion, will I go back?  No.  But I am glad that I went here instead of my initial plans, which were to visit Joel Robuchon's Mansion next door where an average dinner for two runs about a grand.  I won't be revisiting L'Atelier because the cuisine is too Asian for me.  If I'm going to be laying out that kind of dough (which was equivalent to about 15 lap dances at Spearmint Rhino up the street), I should be eating food I know nothing about and enjoying the hell out of it.  And that includes not eating a quail entree served with a sauce my grandmother used to make back at home.

So those are my two cents on Joel Robuchon's L'Atelier, you can take it or you can leave.

The first time we visited was during the soft opening in the beginning of the year. It did not make a lasting impression (good or bad) so we never came back; however, after having dinner nearby, my boyfriend and I decided to come here instead of our usual boba joint. Big mistake. The menu has several options ranging from slushes to smoothies, milk teas, and fruit drinks. You also have the option to add different types of jelly as well. Upon ordering, I opted for the lychee slush with lychee jelly. The cashier asked if I preferred a smoothie or slush and explained the differences. I once again said lychee slush. After my boyfriend ordered, she repeated what we said and asked if we wanted boba. I said ""No thank you, but I want lychee jelly please!"". The order took over five minutes to come out, despite the fact that no one else was there. Once the order came out, it was wrong. There was no lychee jelly and the slush was extra watery. Normally I wouldn't complain, but the drink was pretty bad and the lychee would be its one redemption. As soon as I confronted the cashier and asked for lychee jelly, both women got defensive and blamed me. The manager started up setting up the register for me to pay an additional 50 cents for lychee jelly and kept saying that it was my fault that I didn't correct the cashier when she repeated the order. I honestly wouldn't mind paying the measly 50 cents, even if it was their fault, but due to their rude demeanor, I just cancelled the order and threw my drink away as soon as I walked outside. Overall, I would rate the drinks 2/5 (my boyfriend's fruit tea was decent) and the service 1/5. We ended up making the drive to our usual spot after. If you know me, you know that I will continue drinking something even if I'm not a fan; however, I will never make a visit to here ever again. To all future customers, make sure you articulate and repeat what you want at least five times or else your order will most likely come out wrong.",10/5/2018 3:36,36.149118,-115.15359,1945 Las Vegas Blvd S,NV,Las Vegas,89104,"Drugstores, Health & Medical, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Culinary Pharmacy

Hummus is a modern presentation of traditional Mediterranean flavors and ingredients. As a certified nutritionist, vegetarian, and celiac, it's difficult to always feel confident in the choices I have to eat out. Hummus gives you the freedom to eat to fit your needs- Bodybuilder? Watching your weight? Avoiding meat? Need to add more veg to your diet? Everyone can find what they need. It's been confirmed time and time again that the Mediterranean diet is the healthiest long-term diet, however it can be intimidating to Americans who've eaten a meat-and-starch based diet for years. I grew up eating Mediterranean food, and I'm still impressed with the unique flavor combinations I can achieve in each meal.

First of all, the meal was perfect but the service was incredible.  I regret forgetting the name of our waiter, a young man from South Africa, but I will say his level of service went above and beyond.  He really made us feel special.

We started our meal with the Oysters Rockefeller and they were probably the most amazing Oysters Rockefeller I have ever had.  Soo good, so creamy and perfect.

We then had the lobster bisque and just that soup was worth coming in.  It was incredible, so delicious, so perfect.  Later on that night I wanted to go back just to have more soup.  It was the best Lobster Bisque I have ever tasted.

We shared the Porterhouse for 2.  The meat was perfection and we had the Mac and Cheese side, yes it was rich, but I was on vacation so I treated myself.  It was perfect.

Finished off with a complimentary Cr√®me Brulee to celebrate my sister's birthday.  It was very delicious.

No doubt still a hot-spot amongst tourists, the restaurant itself just under capacity by noon as the line at Carlo's Bake Shop continues to snake out the door at all hours of the day, it was just past 11:15am that one adult and a child checked-in at the hostess podium to be quickly led to a tight two-top adjacent the open kitchen, food displays tempting on all sides as the d√©cor of rolling pins, whisks and ingredients continues to impress without making the environment feel like a 'theme' restaurant in the least.

Half-expecting service to be sub-par, most of the full-time Buffets in town generally better suited to this style of dining than a place converting the dining room into a free-flowing event once a week, it was with greetings from a young man who poured water and occasionally returned to clear plates or refill Coffee that instructions were given to ""get started whenever you like,"" a quick perusal of the options that are mostly laid out on the tableside menu showing a decent variety, though certainly not the same multitude of options as the Hotel's AYCE space.

Obviously focusing on Italian American classics and Buddy's interpretation of the topic by way of long-time Chef Brian Forgione, it was with a plate of Charcuterie, Cheese and Baked Goods that the meal got underway, the 9-year old happy to see Peel n' Eat Shrimp offered, but confused as to why the Salami did not taste like the version offered at Von's, the quality theoretically superior and not nearly as processed but nonetheless lacking in flavor while the Prosciutto, Blue Cheese and Pecorino were all good specimens, though the Focaccia was nearly inedible and hard enough to make one wonder whether it had been baked the previous day.

Modestly impressed by the Croissant as well as two mini-Muffins, a Pain au Chocolat entirely forgettable as a result of too little filling, the decision to investigate the Cake Boss' desserts early was well served by a pot of Tiramisu that would rival any in town, the Red Velvet Cake also quite tasty with a most base and tangy frosting while the Cannoli was much like that across the way, already feeling the sog of being pre-filled and generally underwhelming.

Batting about .500 on Italian Cookies, the Almond Cluster and soft Chocolate far better than the dried Butter rounds topped in Sprinkles or Jam, it was with patience that a fresh pan of pasta was waited on as part of plate three, the Mac n' Cheese Carbonara far too heavily salted to be appreciated for any sort of subtlety while the small Breasts of pounded Chicken Parm and Orecchiette with Italian Sausage were better balanced if not particularly memorable, the surprisingly light Roast Vegetable Frittata offering some evidence of a kitchen that is capable of doing 'high volume' right.

Far more impressed by the Garlic Bread than the Focaccia, crispy and fragrant with just melted Mozzarella or when used to scoop up Grandma's Meatballs and Sauce that takes no short-cuts en route to a fresh Tomato flavor without any added sweetness, choices from the carving station including Spicy Italian Sausage and Smoked Applewood Slab Bacon are well-displayed and prepared properly, the youngster at the table also fond of the Maple-Glazed Ham and sticks of Beef Jerky procured from the Bloody Mary Bar.

Going back to the sweet stuff for plates five and six, the common occurrence of dirty stacked plates and an empty mug at this point almost more amusing than it was an annoyance, fans of Bread Pudding would be well advised to save room for Dessert as the version served hot from a steamer with Caramel Sauce and Whipped Cream is a custard-laden masterpiece that far outperformed Panettone French Toast that is a bit dry along the edges, a better investment for the sweet tooth being the dainty Crespelle served with Nutella, Pureed Raspberries and Whipped Cream...or perhaps a bag of piping hot Italian Donuts offered with the same trio for dipping.

Along with the awesome hospitality, everything we ordered was really really good. What we had was the teriyaki salmon and the fried rice, the son had the spam masubi. What we also tried was the this fried wonton gyoza type thing, I'm not sure what the name of it was, because he brought it out to us ""on the house"". They brought in some side dishes before our meal that was kimchi, sprouts, hotdogs, and some radish type thingy. I really want to describe all my food (but I will only reviews my teriyaki salmon) and everything I sampled from others that were with us, but the thing is, I'm not sure what their meal was, but what I can tell you is that everything I did try was really really good, with no complaints whatsover. 

Ok for our teriyaki salmon, it was probably the best salmon I've ever tasted at a restaurant, they made my food perfect. Don't you hate it when your fish turns out dry because it has been over cooked? well this salmon was a bit rawish in the middle, I guess you can say it was cooked ""rare"" I guess you can say in steak terms. I love raw fish (sushi type) and this meal reminded me just that, cooked on the outside, but slightly in the inside. Just typing about my meal is making me hungry again. It was nice and juice cooked to perfection with some yummy dipping sauce and mac salad and rice on the side. YUUUMMMMMMM

I will cut this review short because I will come back and re review this place. I really wanted to try the oxtail soup on the menu, but already thought we ordered way too much food. I'll be back for more soon.

Usually a good service place + really really good food = 5 stars, but I yet I only gave e'm 4. I will promise an update after I try their oxtail soup and if knocks me out of the park, I will definitely give this place a home run (5 stars).

The most concerning part is that the work they do is faulty.  They did a routing filling in one of my daughters teeth, which looking back was likely improperly done so it needed to be redone based on sensitivity and pain complaints from my daughter twice.  After the last time I took her to a new dentist for a second opinion.  What had happened was they had put a filling in my daughters tooth that was too large, so it fractured her tooth.  As a result, she had to get a crown on the tooth.  My crown was also done improperly as well as number of other fillings for my daughter.

(I am watching the Top Chef DC Reunion as I start to write this) I am not sure if it because we share the same haircut or if it because we both enjoy a Cobb Salad but I just like the guy.  With that in mind, I have to say that I am deeply saddened to give our Vegas Craftsteak experience only two stars.  So you ask, ""how could you slam your follicle challenged brother with such a poor review?""  In a word... SERVICE.
Let me start by saying that I totally get how difficult a server's job is. I worked as a one for many years in both low and high end places.  I know that there are good days and bad days.  I always tip 20% unless something is totally off  and even then I never go below 15%.  Finally, it should be noted that we were dressed nicely (no Judas Priest T-shirts and cutoffs).
I guess we were in trouble when we did not order wine.  Although the list was great, we just we not in the mood.  It seems like as soon as I handed the Wine list back, the service dropped to the Denny's level.  (I don't have a problem with Denny's too, but you get the point)  For some reason we suddenly had two servers.  It was not that it was busy (Tuesday Night) or that we were getting special service.  It was more like we got whomever was walking by at the time.  No check backs, just dish dropping and dish clearing.  Just a horrible experience.  At first I thought perhaps the B Team worked on Tuesdays but we certainly did not pay B Team prices.
To wrap the longest, most boring review in the history of Yelp...  I did complain to the night manager after we paid the check.  I wanted to make it clear that we were not trying to get out of paying anything (food was great) but just that the service sucked.  She thanked us which was all we were looking for.  
Tom...  You are still my man.  Perhaps you should putting on some sort of fake wig and try your place out on a Tuesday.  I think you just may will see what I am talking about.",10/1/2010 0:47,36.067861,-115.1762259,6605 S Las Vegas Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89119,"Tabletop Games, Shopping, Hobby Shops",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,The Gaming Goat

Feature model for Coastal Beauties this babe shared her journey's with Jewel with us for an inside share on her stay at The Cosmo!

The suite's are absolutely amazing!  Great layout, 2 bed rooms, 2 1/2 baths, living room and beautiful views.  This hotel is an event in itself, inside the amazing decor and amenities are to die for.  Check out their pool, bar and hot tub or dine at one of their fantastic restaurants.  Inside the hotel is beautifully bedazzled, jeweled and decorated.  You will get lost in the extremely hypnotizing and comfortable decor!

Jewel recommends Holstein's for Brunch, they have the most amazing Bloody Mary's!  If the bloody mary's don't kick your hangover their milkshakes sure will.  They have both alcohol and alcohol free milk shakes!  Try their Ahi, Wings and Fried Pickles for a delicious sampler of appetizers.  Their burgers are amazing, large and definitely worth saving room for!

If you get the chance to dine at The Cosmo, be sure to check out STK!  According to our Coastal Beauties Babe Jewel- It is the best dinner she has ever had!  Be sure to try the Tuna Tar Tar or Shell Fish Platter appetizers.  The braised short rib was the best entree of the evening, be sure to pair with your favorite red wine this dish was perfectly prepared and cooked to melt off the bone and in your mouth!

I had to get the Wagyu rib-eye steak since it's a rare find to see Wagyu offered at a restaurant.  Also, the cost of Wagyu here is very reasonable relative to the prices in San Francisco.  

BIG bonus:  They ran out of the lobster I had ordered and I was upgraded to a blue lobster caught in Ireland!  That was super generous of the restaurant and really topped off my dinner experience.  By the way, I think the blue lobster is an off-menu item. 

Service was also stellar.  The chef and server were both very attentive to everyone at our table.

A couple times I've had horrible luck with service ... one time my waitress was just down right dismissive and rude, I can say I am a polite person and always respect staff wherever I dine/spend my time. This specific time I ended up requesting a new waitress and everything was fine. 

Another more recent occasion that disappointed me was when I ordered some take out. I was having issues with their phone number, it was saying it was disconnected for a while, but eventually I got through, much to my relief  

I ordered and was told it would take about 20 minutes. I went in 15 minutes later and the young woman at the front podium told me it would be another 20 minutes. I was a little surprised. 

Anyways I step out for a couple minutes and come back sooner than she said in hopes maybe it was ready. I go inside and I see my order bagged up and sitting on the shelf ready to go, yay! I asked the woman if my food was ready and she again told me no it would take longer, not bothering to check if the food that was ready was even mine. 

 Anyways 10 minutes goes by she finally looks at the tag/receipt on the bag and she called my name, and was like oh it's ready now. She acted as if I hadn't been standing there for almost 15 minutes staring at the food. I was annoyed, I could have been home eating it by then. And it wasn't super busy either. She was barely applying herself. I  found it rather insulting too cause she didn't care at all.

Oyster Bar is located in the Palace Station Hotel. They serve seafood based soups, oysters and a couple other things I haven't bothered to look at. There are only about 15 seats around the bar so the wait can be very long at peak times. Come off peak and save your stomach from eating itself while watching others enjoy their meal. I was only in Vegas two nights and we came here twice, it was THAT GOOD. I had the pan roast, jambalaya, shrimp scampi and gumbo. I would have to say I like the jambalaya the best, but would order it with the rice on the side. The pan roast is cream based which can be good and bad depending on your digestive system. Portions are HUGE, but it's nice to get different dishes to share. The gumbo comes second, the scampi third and the pan roast last. Not that the pan roast is bad in any way, but I don't care for cream based soups. Did I mention wine pours are very generous? To-the-rim! 

I even ordered a togo order to bring back to LA for my man, now that's LOVE!!

Be kind to the waitress and cook here, they work very hard and are amazing at what they do. If you're in a rush, this isn't your place. It's well worth the wait.

I care for places like this more than the fancy strip celebrity chef joints. The food sticks to my bones and I'm more than happy to pay. You won't leave disappointed or hungry.

When you first walked in it smelled of soup and seafood. It was quite busy when we came, but there were empty tables so we were into our booth fairly quickly. Our server took quite awhile to come say hi and ask us for our drinks. I don't eat shabu shabu very often so I wanted him to explain what we were supposed to do. Instead, he just dismissed me and said go pick up your sauce and look at the menu and I'll come back. So the entire table went to get the sauces they wanted and came back. Then we ordered our soup base I guess that's what he called it. He suggested not to order the spicy if we couldn't handle it and so I just got one that wasn't spicy. 

 It took 4 times of asking to actually get our drinks and he never came back to ask us if we had any questions or if we were doing okay. That's one part of the reason they got a 2 Star rating from me. 

We had to figure out the whole conveyer belt thing on our own and asked several other workers what things were since our waiter was non existent. We managed to get through dinner without our waiter and the food was okay not the best shabu shabu I've had. 

When we were finally done our waiter showed up to give us the bill. We asked two split it between two people and evenly between two cards. Easy enough right? Boy was this wrong! We all were so confused and saw he charged my card twice for the same amount. We wanted to make sure he never charged our friends card before we left and let him know he made a mistake if indeed he didn't charge the card. 

So we waited for him and when he finally showed up he kept pestering me to take my card back so he could credit back what his mistake was and charge the other card instead. I at first kindly told him no that's fine. Then he kept insisting. That made me angry so I told him no again and said you might instead charge me a third time since you have already charged me twice and I don't want to deal with that hassle so let it be and just learn from your mistakes tonight.

We had just planned on going to the regular pools at Aria when we spied this place and became curious. There was a podium we passed that had guys handing out VIP passes to young ladies walking by. When my wife and I stopped, they did their best to ignore us...it was actually quite comical....let's ignore the paying guests! LOL That's a strange business model. Finally one of the gents asked my wife if he could help her....she asked about the club and fees. He said she could definitely get in for free but that I would normally need to pay. But then he said it was fairly slow, so he gave me a pass as well. We didn't have our ID's so I ran back to the room to get ours. The club staff were actually fairly pleasant and helpful. We shared one lounge chair given the $100 minimum. It was after 3pm so we weren't going to splurge for two lounges. After 4pm, one of the staff came over and said we could take another adjacent lounge for free. The majority of the customers were 20-30 year olds and we're quite friendly and very amusing to watch. My wife and I likened the final bill to being the same as a show bill......except the customers were the show! We had two pitchers of margaritas and two bottled waters. The grand total was somewhere around $170.00 with the tip. The venue was cigar friendly, so I was quite content in sitting back, smoking my stogies, sipping on a margarita and watching the madness unfold. Actually, a couple of people came by and remarked how good my cigars smelled and wanted to know where I had gotten them. The staff seemed to be having as much fun as the crowd. One of the waitresses was thrown in the pool by a few of her coworkers. The music was bass pounding hip-hop....not exactly our thing but it was a great soundtrack for the spectacle. Overall we had a good time. The staff was very attentive....coming by to refill your glass, empty your ash tray and make sure you didn't need anything else. The club closes at 6pm and when we left we could very clearly see the lack of any vibe at the basic pools. They were nice...but very laid back. So, it's all in what you are looking for.

We have eaten there numerous times and the food is good. We love the crab, so sweet and meaty, even the snow crab. The sausage is perfect, crisp skin and just the right amount of spice. The etouffee is yummy, it actually tastes like the one I had in New Orleans. The fries are good, not really spicy though.  We never had the lobster there, just figured crab was their thing.  My only issue is the explanation of the spice level is sort of off. I can eat very spicy food, but for some reason, maybe due to the messiness, I get cuts all over my mouth from the peppers. On my second visit, I even downgraded the spice level, but yet again the same occurrence. I tend to now stay close to mild. Maybe I have sensitive skin, I don't know. Never the less, it's always a very good meal. But we have had better now. Don't get me wrong it's awesome food. Service is hit or miss. They are just so busy. But even really busy I have had an awesome male server.

These are my negatives 1.) What is up with the tiny, tiny plastic ramekin for all those fries?? Seriously? Every time I go I have to ask for ketchup like 6 times and every single time (with exception of that awesome guy server we had) they bring 1 tiny, tiny ramekin. I don't consider myself the queen of common sense but I feel like I am dealing with servers that might not have the sense of urgency and common sense gene! If you are busy, wouldn't you just say  ""F it, let me bring her the freaking bottle, because I don't have time for crazy ketchup lady!! "" ?

But no, again comes that plastic ramekin of 1 tablespoon of ketchup. Oh, OK I have calmed down, please excuse my rant. I guess I didn't realize how upset I was about the ketchup, I will get over it and move on. ( I don't mean to offend any of those servers they do work hard and service really isn't bad) Plus, I haven't been there in a few months, so maybe things have changed.

Negative #2) The seating is a little congested for my liking. Tables are way to close together. I do understand it's a small place, so it's to be expected. But for me, when I want to relax and enjoy a meal this venue isn't appetizing to me.

3.) 2 restrooms, again it's limited spacing so I understand. But it doesn't mean I like it. And no bar to wait until your table is ready. Maybe I am spoiled. I don't like sitting, if you are lucky to get a seat ,Like I am waiting for a bus outside.

Well, in conclusion, is it good food.? Yes it's great! I chose to come here when the negatives are not going to bother me.

I am super WAY over due for this joint.  I do think I have told at least 15 people about this place since our visit last Saturday.  If that doesnt say how I feel about this place, how about the leftovers that I ate for breakfast the next day.  Yes, I must say this is simply (but not simply stated) the best BBQ I have ever EVER had.

Dont let the location fool you...its part of its finger lickin good charm and you cant beat the smell of pure goodness when you pull into the parking lot.  When we first arrived a couple was leaving voicing that they will be back next year - as they come here every year when they visit Vegas.  I think that says alot too.
...a must have for tourists too?!

We both ordered the sliders-both coming with 3 and you can pick what meat you want.  I had the chicken and the brisket while my man had the chicken, brisket and the hot link sliders.  He said the hot links were his favorite-IF there could even be a favorite.  All of it was totally fab.  For sides we had the waffle fries and the mac and cheese.  The waffle fries were sprinkled with a sweet and salty flavoring that I loved and I'm still craving and wont be satisfied until I have more.  The mac and cheese was super creamy.  I thought it was very good.  Alot of the times mac comes out all dry and coagulated.  Not the case here.  I could literally eat a big bowl of it and call it a day.  ***ehem But I wouldnt recommend it only because there is SO much more important things to savor.  Lets talk about the meat - yes their slogan is that they ""rub their meat"" and however you take it consider that some good lovin (hehe).  The meat is smokey and savory....meat with FLAVOR!  The sauce was perfect (not too sweet, not too thick)-and Im very picky about sauce.   The portions were so huge.  I'm sure the guy thought I was not sure what I was getting into when I ordered the 3 sliders.  I brought home 1 1/2 that was leftover and like I said I think I must have been dreaming about it all night because I did have to dig into that first thing the next morning.  As I opened the box all I could smell was the smokey heavenly goodness and I knew right then it was going to be a good day.

So yeah on Wednesday I was sat down and asked to not be mad.....hmmm yes my man went there for lunch without me.  And YES damn right I was mad.  LOL  Yes, peeps....it is JUST THAT GOOD.

My girlfriend and I were high on life looking for a view of the fountains plus a few treats so we stopped here. We were sad we did. 

We felt ignored at first ... but place our order tempted by the yummy menu. We waited for almost 20 min and one item showed up. The food was actually good so we waited for the next item. After some time passed we flagged our waiter and mentioned the loooong wait ...  plus asked for some water. He assured us things were on there way.

What happened next was just comedy. A second waiter showed up with two empty glasses. No water ... no food ... More waiting.

We eventually got water and our food ... but the chocolate fondue was served cold. We complained ... and our waiter said thats just how its surved.

Customer service at the airport location was abhorrent-- I didn't need to hear that the agent's shift ended in 15 minutes and at that time he was walking away from the counter. 
The car interior was stained from top to bottom (this not unusual for rental cars, but this one was particularly stained).
BE CAREFUL INSPECTING YOUR CAR in the dark parking garage because you'll drop it off in a well-lit location and they will look for ANYTHING!!
They claimed I did something to the front bumper.  A few weeks later I got a packet of information from Subrogation Management Team (some sort of collection agency) saying I owed $400 for the repair.  They would not provide any documentation that the car was repaired (They only provided an ""estimate"" for the repair) nor would they provide additional documentation to substantiate the loss of use fee they charged.  Payless Rental never returned my calls.  Subrogation Management Team would send me emails but would not respond to some of my emails saying they had ""problems with their email system"".

I actually asked a friendly looking man standing in front of the restaurant if he would take a picture of me and my wife in front of the beautiful fountain. He took a picture and then tried to hand me a menu and invited me in for happy hour. I felt a lil obligated after he took a picture to at least take a glance. To my surprise the prices were very affordable. The happy hour menu had 6 dollar apps and drinks for 7 dollars. I was shocked because i had looked at menus at the other two restaurants right next door and i was figuring that Trevi would be more expensive considering it was the nicest looking restaurant. We decided we could go in for a drink. I asked for a patio table so we could people watch. The place was packed but we got a table right away. You could sense that everyone around looked happy so i was really feeling the place. My server came to the table and greeted himself almost as soon as we sat down. His name was Rufus and he was the most fun waiter I've ever had. He was making us laugh the whole time he took care of us. I ordered a Peroni and my wife got the pomegranate cosmo. You cant really mess up a beer but my wife loved her drink. We were not planning on eating because it was so late but im soooooooo glad we did. My wife an i split the house dish the linguine el fruite de mare. Rufus had the kitchen split it in the back for us and they didnt charge us for it. It was the best seafood pasta ive ever had. The seafood was fresh and you could tell It was the homemade seafood cream sauce that made the dish because the ingredients were very simple. I damn near licked my bowl but i didnt want to be that guy. We just hung out and watched all all the random people walking around. It was a great time. My check came out to just over 45 dollars and it was worth every cent. I felt like i cheated them. I had more then just a meal, i felt like a had a true dining experience and at a very affordable cost and thats why im giving trevi a 5 star. Next time i am in the forum shops i know exactly where ill be going. I want to go back with an empty stomach and the intent to sit down and eat because remember we only came in for a drink but we were enjoying ourselves so we just kind of went with it and took Rufus's suggestion and got the house dish.

It may be because I like to try so many different things and buffets allow me to do this all in one seating (well technically more since you go back and forth to the buffet.)  This buffet is a really good one and also had no line which was surprising although we did go a little over an hour before closing which was probably the reason.

The layout was nice with the many various stations from pasta, to carving, to salad, to desert there was something for almost everyone.  All of the food was delicious and was not old and dried out like many other buffets.  While everything was delicious and there were many choices, a lot of the choices seemed more like side dishes rather than entrees which was disappointing.  

In the end though all the food was delicious and while maybe not the best buffet on the strip it is one of the better ones.

LK9f8Ys5lt1AKlLzaGeywg,0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,2LL-pWxdM_rvnaIpNxezsQ,2,2,1,1,"Food trucks have become a huge trend these days, but I'm not one to fight lines and hunt them down around town. I'd much rather go to a fixed location and order something whenever I want, which is why I had to take a trip to Slidin' Thru HQ to see if the sliders in their restaurant are any better than the ones on their truck. Simple answer: nope.

The HQ is located near the airport in an odd office park. There's a bar next door to it that's very easy to find because of all the signage, but the HQ has nothing but a sticker in the window so my friend and I drove by it twice. Maybe they don't want to be found even by those trying to look for them? The interior of the place is something out of a comic book, insane colors, loud music, and comic book style art spray painted all over the walls. It wasn't too bad, but the seating choices were quite limited. I think there were two booths that could seat about six, a round table with a few chairs, and a long high top table with maybe another 8 chairs or so.  Not sure what they do when there's a rush, although based on the location maybe there never is...

For the sake of variety and hoping I would hit the jackpot with at least one decent slider, I ordered three different kinds from a selection of six Angus sliders, a pulled pork slider, an eggplant option, and a 'mystery' selection.  They also offer four different kinds of Super Fries with all sorts of insane toppings, as well as regular and sweet potato.

The first one up was the Barby, which has melted cheddar, caramelized jalapenos, crispy fried onion strips, bacon and bbq sauce. Quite a lot of toppings for a little slider so I expected much flavor, but what I got was A LOT of dryness.  The word 'dry' is going to become a common theme here I should mention. The bun on this slider was extremely dry and a bit hard, but the meat was beyond dry. Luckily(?) the onions and bbq sauce completely consumed all flavor of this concoction, so I was a bit distracted from the dryness by the taste of a bad version of KC Masterpiece sauce. Strike one.

The next one up was the Captain's Order, complete with roma tomatoes, arugula, bacon, feta cheese, saut√©ed onions and a balsamic reduction. Once again the bun and meat were beyond dry, but lucky for me this time the balsamic commanded all flavor. The bacon had decent flavor, but was totally overcooked and, you got it, dry. Not much else to say about this one, just underwhelmed again. Strike two.

My final attempt at decency came from the Pep Pep, which the guy behind the register described as an 'In-N-Out clone'. This one has lettuce, tomato, pickles, bacon, saut√©ed onions, cheddar and super sauce. There are few burgers out there that are even close to being as good as the Almighty, but I must say that this one was good. I only wished that I had ordered three of them. Upon my very first bite I exclaimed that it actually tasted like a burger. The pickles were good, the bacon was ok, and the meat somehow retained some moisture this time. The meat on its own had ok flavor, and I was happy I ended on this one and not the others.
 
As for the fries, I went with the Barby Fries which are a play on the Barby slider. That was a bit of a mistake, if you're getting a few different kinds of sliders here, try to get one of the fries based on a burger you're not getting for some more variety. Or, if you're not looking to order a giant bucket of fries for $5 that are more than enough for 3-4 people, try the regular or sweet potato choices. The fries are not too bad on their own, but layered with melted cheddar, bacon, caramelized jalapenos and bbq sauce they become something totally different. They get soggy very quickly, and the sauce overpowers all flavors once again. The onions taste good, very reminiscent of a Bloomin' Onion if you've ever dared to order one. The bacon bits were overcooked and had a burnt grease flavor, the jalape√±os tasted good but were buried in the rest of the flavors.

Maybe the most acceptable part of this meal is the price for three sliders: $7. I think it's very reasonable if you could get three that aren't dry that you might actually like, but once you combine that with $5 for the insane Super Fries and a drink, it quickly becomes a $15+ meal which is a bit steep for this. The fries are more than enough to share with a few people so you could split the cost with a few other folks, otherwise I would stick to the regular fries for a much more reasonable $2. 

Overall I fail to see what all the hype is about. Sure the food truck thing is cool, but unless you can actually deliver a good product like some other folks I don't know what to tell you. The interior of their HQ is probably cool if you're in high school, but if you're looking for a decent place to sit down and get something slightly better than fast food you should probably skip the HQ.",11/14/2011 2:57,36.26635328,-115.259479,"5770 Centennial Center Pkwy, Ste 115",NV,Las Vegas,89149,"Home & Garden, Furniture Stores, Shopping, Home Services, Home Decor, Home Organization, Cabinetry, Interior Design",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,California Closets - Las Vegas - North

Very nice  ""cushy"" seat actually ! Ordered a bar special drink Kick'd up Caddy with Patron Tequilia, Grand Marnier, Lime and spicy jalape√±o's were floating on top and the rim was dusted with spiced salt - which was like chilli powder, salt and something else I just can't put my finger on.....but BLOW your socks off good ! Every sip was better and better ! So good that I had to have THREE ... I'm making that at home for sure - thanks Guy ! 

Order Tuna Sashimi Tacos and they had fresh Tuna and a mango salsa with creme and a wonton wrapper as the taco shell served with fresh lines and some radish. They were amazing and only 4 very small tacos. Wish you could order that with something else small for lunch cause they were very small - but it was only an appetizer. So after my second drink I ordered the Triple T fries with Truffles, Gouda and a truffle drip, OMG that was the best plate of French  fries that I ever ate (beats EARL'S truffle fries) thin little shoestring fries with truffle oil and very fine shredded Gouda on top with a mayo and truffle oil dip - all was absolutely amazing. I couldn't even make a dent in the fries. If I was home would have taken a doggie bag on those for sure ! Out of this world good.  

The place is a great buzz - music was just right and not too loud at all and played fantastic music !!!! The bar like most was busy with action and a great patio outside with heaters !  I did expect more on the menu from Guy, but I was not at all disappointed. So many chefs have their own places now that they never come to, but you buying their concept of food, decor and the whole package knowing it is the true essence of them - at least that's my thought after three drinks ! 

Awesome place - wish it was closer to home !! 

So glad I came here to enjoy and after three drinks I will waddle my way back to the hotel to burn this off for sure !!",12/22/2015 22:54,36.111827,-115.170537,"3663 Las Vegas Blvd, Ste D-37, Miracle Mile Shops 191",NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Shopping, Jewelry",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Kay

I had a very good experience with Wireless Doctor.  Fair prices, nice people, good work.  I have an LG V10 and had cracked the screen.  I didn't expect them to have this screen in stock, and they didn't, so they ordered it. It was supposed to take 3-5 days to get here, but the nice lady kept calling around after I left the store and finally found it at a local distributor and got it same day. Bonus points for that.  I brought my phone down at 9am and she said it would be ready by 11am or noon.  Here's where the only problem I had came into play.  I was working 30 miles away, so I put the job on hold at noon to go pick up my phone (my cell is critical to my livelihood). When I showed up at 12:30, I found only the technician at the store, and he had put my phone behind a bunch of other phone repairs from people who had come in after me.  He said my phone wouldn't be ready until around 3pm.  I wasn't happy about that, since it meant I had just wasted over an hour of my time and would have to drive 30 miles back to my job and another 30 to pick up the phone later than promised.

In fact, the quote he gave me for monthly service was, IMO, a little too low and IF we had been happy with his service, my husband and I decided that we would pay him more than he was asking for.

He said he didn't have his schedule on him but that he would text me that evening when he gets home to tell me when he could do the work.  I did not hear from him that evening, so I texted him the following morning to just remind him that we were waiting for him to get back to us to schedule a work date.

I see that we're not the first people that he's done this to.  Shame on him for treating potential customers like this.

Jay was my tech, he took me as a walk-in, and I am so thankful he did!!! I needed my nails done for my office Christmas party and I waited until the last minute, luckily I found Modern Nails and I could not be more ecstatic!! I needed a fill after waiting over a month to get my nails done again. Jay fixed my horrendous set of gel polish acrylics and made them works of art! He made them match my dress absolutely perfectly and surprised me with a design that matches wonderfully. I literally won't go to another nail salon again, especially after trying (and failing) to find somewhere that wouldn't have me leaving with a lack of confidence and the desire to rip my nails off my finger. I was so upset at how horribly my previous set came out, and I can't believe the magic he worked on the monstrosity that was my nails. Their selection of gel colors is astounding! And their matte get top coat..... oh my goodness. Last place I went to gave me ""matte finish"" and it was nothing even remotely close to what I'd asked for. This fill could not have turned out more perfect! I am so confident now with my nails I want to show them off the everyone! Not to mention I believe I spent MAYBE an hour there! He's so fast and efficient!!  Thank you Jay!!! I'll see you and your amazing salon again in 2 weeks!!

They always call when they have questions and are detailed and service oriented. I could not ask for kinder, more caring people who treat you like family and work on ensuring your desires are met for your child. Let's be clear, nothing is fool proof and accidents like at home can happen ...no one is perfect and no daycare can prevent certain issues or problems  (chicken pox, hfm, other viruses) but as things come up the day care is always upfront about actions and steps taken to prevent further issues and acts on and is responsive to feedback.  I could not ask for more honest people to care for my child. 

Kristen the manager always is available to meet with parents and answer whole heartedly any questions people may have. I hope parents do research on other day cares and know what they are getting when they enroll their child here. They do art, they do dance, play and sing, they teach sign language and Spanish, keep your child on point for their age group as long you are ok with the progression, have genuine daycare providers without high turn over, people who truly care and like what they do and who they do it for! They don't leave, It's impressive. 

The facility is spotless and completely maintained with huge open rooms and tons of toys and different engagement and sensory activities for kids to be a part of.

Jennifer was our waitress, and let me point out that she was TOP NOTCH. This girl is good at her job and our experience was in no way her fault. She was probably the best waitress I've ever had. 

So, we've sat down, Jennifer comes to greet us right away and fill up our water. I order green tea, and 15 min later it comes out luke warm and very flowery. I just wanted some pure HOT green tea. But hey, it's a new experience, so I drank my luke warm flowery beverage. We promptly got the Brussels sprouts, and they were AMAZING. 

Then, 12-15 more minutes for our edamame... And then 20 more minutes for our crispy rice spicy tuna appetizer... And then the biggest wait of all... Over 30 MORE minutes pass after the spicy tuna, waiting for our next salmon/caviar appetizer and yellowtail sushi roll... We can't talk to each other, it's too loud, and my tea is now gone from luke warm to cold... So we give up and ask for our check, we were going to head over to umami burger for the dinner we never received at Katsuya. Jennifer is super apologetic, agreeing it's taken much too long. She assures that the sushi is on it's way, but she's taking it off our bill. The manager comes over and sees if there is anything else she could do and also apologizes. (It was really sweet, but then we became the center of attention... :( ) 

The sushi roll was good but the salmon appetizer was on soapy cucumbers which definitely took away from the freshness of the salmon caviar bite. 

We really appreciate their kindness, apologies, and the personal care after the fact. Jennifer had no control over how the food was coming out of the multiple kitchens, so we don't blame her. 

Am I dying to come back? Not after that, no. We will likely give it another shot in a few months when they've worked out the kinks of having four kitchens. I hope it's a better experience next time... When my husband surprises me with a nice dinner out, it's a letdown when it goes like this. :/",9/28/2014 16:51,36.1066864,-115.1370841,4550 South Maryland Pkwy,NV,Las Vegas,89119,"Tobacco Shops, Shopping, Party Supplies, Event Planning & Services",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Purple Haze Smoke Shop

Employees - These people had awful attitudes. Sorry that I bothered you by ordering food and trying to pay for it. The guy cutting the brisket was clueless. I asked for a certain cut and it was like he either didn't know what I was talking about or didn't care.

Dr. O'Dea and his staff were very personable and attentive. They reassured me that all would be ok. Dr. O'Dea and his staff were able to calm me down and take care of my baby at the same time.  As soon as Dr. O'Dea looked at the X rays he took, he was able to quickly determine the issue with our baby.  He went over the X rays with me and told me exactly what was wrong.

Living room, bedroom, nice bathroom, and a 1/2 bath by the front door.  The overall service (lobby, room, etc.) was not bad.  The rooms were clean and well stocked with everything you need.  Pretty cushy place.  Since Mandalay is at the far end of The Strip, the price here is pretty good compared to other suites in other hotels especially considering how nice Mandalay's pools are.

They did mishandle a couple of things which made me hesitate to give them a full 5 stars.  The towels were old and scratchy...both times.  The TV (while big) was useless due to the subpar cable in the room.  Why advertise you have an HD flatscreen when you have no HD channels?  We ordered the room with a pull-out sofa sleeper in the living room (which was suppose to be standard).  But the sofa we got wasn't a sleeper so we just sort of had to make due sleeping on the sofa for 2 nights.  

One morning we got a wake up call at 8am.  That really SUCKED considering we went to bed at 5am.  However, the call we actually requested for 10am never came causing us to oversleep and miss a poker tournament.

Anyway Bachi Burger is one of those foodie locations that all my friends seem to want to try when they visit Vegas and I usually do highly recommend it to visitors. The restaurant is on the small side, very casual, and filled with tons of modern angry panda art. Their menu covers a huge variety of Asian cultures and flavors in a fusion format combined with classic American burger options such as bacon and fried onions. Generally sweeter than salty. If you really want to get fancy feel free to slap on a side of foie gras though. They have a nice selection of beverages and craft beer as well. 

Things I like: Spicy Miso burger, KiKi's burger (underrated but I love the mushrooms and bacon and gruyere), oxtail fries, sweet potato fries, Hitachino Nest white ale. I haven't met a burger I didn't like! 

Things I dislike: My waiter - he was awkward and cracked a ""Ho"" joke, regarding ""Mr.Ho's Burger"", to a party of Chinese people one of which actually had the last name Ho. It was way more weird than offensive. My burger has been undercooked the last two times so I started ordering it more well done yet it still comes out equally undercooked. I hate asking people to take things back but when they do take your burger they return it to you with the same bun and patty but new toppings. I've never been to a restaurant where they've done that and it seems strange. Parmesan fries are slightly off too lol.

Overall yeah I'd still come back and hope I didn't get the same waiter and that my burger is cooked to a nice correct medium rare. When they do get it right THAT IS A TASTY BURGER doe.",4/23/2014 18:23,36.204656,-115.254019,"2411 Tech Center Ct, Ste 107",NV,Las Vegas,89128,"Uniforms, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Campus Club Uniforms- North

BUT for Vegas I think this pizza is awesome and definitely stays true to the ""art form"" that is Chicago pizza. I hate when places call their pizza Chicago style and just serve you pan-pizza. Chicago pizza is NOT pan pizza. 

The bottom of the crust shouldn't be too thick.. the cheese has to be stringy and gooey and the tomato sauces goes on TOP. That is Chicago style!

I live in another state for work but I still wanted to have my wedding in my home town.  Planning a wedding long distance is extremely stressful.  I pretty much did all of my planning on line and on the phone.  I had my mother and best friend check out Sunset Gardens for me.  They loved the place so I picked it for my wedding venue.

  About two months prior to my wedding date (May 4, 2013), I got calls from the cake maker and flower vendor.  They were very helpful with examples over email and there were a few websites I was able to look at to make my final decisions.  I got a phone call from one of the planners about a month out for the rest of the details.  I was a little nervous because it all seemed so easy.  The staff at Sunset Gardens really put me at ease and assured me that they would take care of everything.  Through the whole process I was in contact with Tony, the owner/wedding planner.  The man is a god send.  He answered all my questions and I had quite a few.  He even thought of things I didn't think of and I consider myself a very detail oriented person.  

  The week of my wedding I went to Sunset Gardens to finally check out the venue.  I was fully impressed.  The place is beautiful and it can hold up to three weddings.  There is privacy for each ""room"" so the brides don't  see each other.  The pictures on the website really don't do it justice.  You have to see it to believe it.  A few days prior I got a phone call from the wedding DJ (DJ Syd) and the pastor. They were extremely friendly.  Everything you need for your wedding is in the same shopping center as Sunset Gardens.  It's very convenient!  I went to the dress store to get my bridesmaids dresses steamed before the ceremony and the dresses were in the dressing room hours before the ceremony.

   The day of my wedding I met my coordinator for the day, Chris.  Chris was nice, funny and had every detail worked out before I got there.  He, like the rest of the staff, totally put me at ease.  I felt like I didn't have to do anything.  I ended up staying at the venue in my dressing room a few hours before the ceremony to wait for my makeup artist.  I actually felt like I was at home because of how warm the staff was and how adamant they were in ensuring I was comfortable.  It really was a great experience.

  The ceremony and reception turned out to be perfect.  The catering staff helped me set up the centerpieces.  That was a huge help.  My guests told me that the food served was the best wedding food they ever had and some got seconds.  Our cake was amazing.  The ambiance was beautiful.  The open bar was a great highlight.  My only issue was that the DJ announced the wrong name for our flower girl.  We didn't end up getting DJ Syd, I believe we got Rufus.  The photographer had a lot of great picture ideas. I can't wait to see them.  

  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone planning a wedding in Vegas.  I wish we had more time at the reception.  3 hours was definitely not enough.  Our guests had so much fun that I had to have my family members push them out.  People did not want to leave.    This was totally worth every penny.

The manager told me prior to booking he'll have us all start at the same time. I don't mind us not sitting all together because I understand we all are not getting the same type of service. As long as they were able to accommodate all of us, I'll be more than happy and grateful. 

I'll admit that some of our group showed up late and the same guy whom I spoke with that morning told me we weren't going to all start same time anyways so it's ok but that they were running on a tight schedule. I respect your time and I did apologized that not everyone was there on time. 

At first glance the place looked clean but the towel my nail tech placed underneath my hands had hair on them and the towel did not look like it had been washed anytime recently. I kept picking at it and trying to hint her but she ignored it. 

I looked at the nail clipper that she used on me, it did not look clean either. When she was cutting my cuticles, she cut way too high and my finger bled . I had to kindly reminded her that there's blood dripping from my finger. She apologized and cleaned it up for me and put anti septic on it. She moves on to the next finger and guess what?? She cuts too high again causing my finger to bleed. 

When I was done with my service, I told the front desk guy I got cut and it was starting to swell up and that it hurts. I showed him my fingers and he and another nail tech looked at it and say "" oh it's swollen because your cuticles got cut and it's irritated. Keep it clean..."". Ok... as time went on I was still in the shop because my other friends were still getting their nails done. An hour has passed and my fingers was still swollen and painful to touch. I asked another nail tech about it and she said she'll put more anti septic on it to kill all bacteria. 

The front desk guy hesitantly came up to me and gave me my refund back because he saw how concerned I was with my swollen fingers. He should have not taken my money in the first place when I showed him my swollen fingers. He probably knew how paranoid I was and how bad the cut was. He said he didn't want me leaving their salon all ""whatever"". I think he meant to say he didn't want me to leave the salon with an infection? Well, I was upset. Never had my cuticles cut so bad where it'll swell up for 4 days. I also found out 3 of my other friends got their cuticles cut and their fingers swelled up as well.

Long story short , the equipment here isn't clean and the techs don't have enough experience. If I was wrong, a third of our party wouldn't have swollen cut fingers...",12/21/2017 6:13,36.12745055,-115.1725778,"3200 Las Vegas Blvd S, Ste 1360, Fashion Show Mall",NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Accessories, Men's Clothing, Shopping, Women's Clothing, Fashion",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Scotch & Soda

The never ending hallways is a problem.  On the first night, one of my friends was in the hallway on the phone and started pacing.

Why do I love Rollin' Pizza Pies?  Let me count the ways...

1) crispy pizza dough with fluffy crust

2) FRESH and often LOCAL ingredients

3) Owners are willing to make custom orders, add whatever, or even split their speciality pies in half so you can try more than one flavor!

4) creativity in pizza ingredient combos

5) hilarious and clever pizza names 

6) great lunch special (2 slices and a soda for $5)

7) the why knot garlic knots...enough said

8) they post their location on Facebook everyday so I know where to go harass them!

9) you can order via phone, in person, or FACEBOOK- say what!?!?!

10) The owners are just lovely friendly people who don't judge me for my obsession with pizza!!!!

I ordered the carnitas tacos. The carnitas meat itself had a good shredded texture with solid flavor. The tortilla itself was rather bland and tore very easily so I had to eat half of the tacos with a fork. No biggie, but eating tacos with a fork is kinda weird. Other than that, the tacos were made with a pineapple salsa that had a good sweet tartness from the pineapple balanced against the heat of the peppers. This is what gave the tacos its signature taste and it tasted okaaaay. Nothing mind-blowingly spectacular but it's definitely different and it works!

Some of my other friends got quesadillas which actually looked and smelled fantastic. And then other other friends got the baja sandwich which is like a torta. That looked quite delicious too and it was huge! They were only able to finish half and had to take the rest home to save for later!

Warning: This place serves you infinite chips with a red sauce and a yellow sauce. Super addictive. We must've went through 10 baskets of these chips and by the time our food was finally served, we were all too full!!

Overall, it was a decent experience. Not the greatest Mexican food I've had, but it's far from the worse.

The wait one Saturday for 2 over the Fourth of July weekend was about 30 minutes. There isn't much of a waiting area and they only take your first name.  If you're not crowded near the hosts' stand you may not hear your name. Another couple tried to take my spot. Once seated,  the service was great. There were enough misting hoses to make sitting outside comfortable. 
The food though- you'll either love it or hate it. 
There is absolutely no way you can walk out of here feeling satisfied without devouring over a couple of day's worth of fat and cholesterol.  We tried the Fireball Whiskey wings and they were too sweet and dry but the highlight of our food. We had the Cajun and Motley Que, both were very over the top. It was a carnival of flavors that did not blend well. It's like they put the whole kitchen sink in each entree so there's no subtly of flavors. Just a mix and fat and wackiness. We could not enjoy the food. I enjoy curious flavors and trying new food, but this is smothered oil, gravies and sauces all in one topped with whatever can be fried. This will probably delight many but disgust others. If you're after heartattck type food, you'll love it. If on the other hand you're looking for a good burger, anything at Gordon Ramsays Burger tops this place.

Now with that said this place if Effin Hell for food!

It was a group of 10 girls we had stayed at different hotels and decided to meet at Paris for our final stop. We decided to munch here what a big NO NO! So we looked at the menu and I decided to get the Chicken Parmesan sandwich. Well I paid, and went to the sandwich station and saw that on my receipt said chicken salad sandwich. I went back to the cashier explained to her that I wanted Chicken Parmesan she then corrected it, and put Turkey sandwich. So I told the sandwich ladies ""Hey no! I want Chicken Parmesan""  What does she do! she gets the chicken salad and starts working on that. ""HELLO! NO that's not what I want"" She said "" You want it in a wrap""..lol ""No, I want  Chicken Parmesan""  "" I don't know what that is""  ""should I take a picture of the menu"" I asked. my friend next to me was having the same problem. 

I finally received a half-ass sandwich with just chicken onions and lettuce!... after paying $12 that's all I received.after all this my friend was still waiting I finished my sandwich she was still waiting! finally they gave her the sandwich. She complained, manager did nothing about it. She had to argue with him to give her her Money back! NEVER AGAIN! Everyone in my group had a problem except those who got the pizza.

Only been opened for about a month, this new restaurant concept has it all, over the top fresh seafood, insanely reasonable prices, and knowledgeable and cheerful employees. The service was fast and on point. There were 3 of us in my party, and our waitress suggested the Set 4 for $69.99.  This combo comes with wedge salad, corn cheese, and stone bowl rice or noodle soup. It also comes with 2 appetizer dishes. There were 9 choices to choose from. We picked the Seafood Pancake (a MUST order), and the Combination Seafood Soup. The Set 4 comprised of Manila clams (lots of it), one large clam, mussels, shrimps, hotate scallops, pink scallops, corn, 1 sausage, baby octopus, and a Captain's Special Tray.  Let's start with the Seafood Pancake, OMG!!! I have never eaten a more delicious seafood pancake in my life. It was perfectly prepared.

Dinner: (4pm-3am) $25.95

Very tight quarters in this sushi joint, we arrived early (about 6pm Sunday) and luckily my hungry party of 4 didn't have to wait to be seated.

Let's see...the short story of it is, I really wasn't impressed or satisfied with their rolls and nigiri. There were only 4 items on the menu that I liked, though, they weren't life changing. With their rolls, we all looked at each other and were like wow, they really packed the rice in there - It was like a rice roll and not a sushi roll, all rice and no filling. It was very disappointing (and filling). 

The good:
-Sashimi Roll -  (1 order per person and it's an tiny itty bitty portion) we all really enjoyed the flavors on this one. Refreshing, sweet, and lovely fish texture and flavor. 
-Salmon Nigiri - the salmon was sweet and buttery. The lemon slices on top were cut too thick so the flavor was too overwhelming and it took away from the salmon flavor. We ate the rest of the nigiri without it. 
-Seafood Tostada - 1 crunchy wonton chip topped with a mystery seafood mix in a poke style marinade. It was crisp and refreshing. 
- uni for AYCE was 1 order per person. It was very fresh and sweet.

The bad: 
-Crunchy roll- a plain jane CA roll and some sprinkles of tempura flakes. Not sure what's the deal, but It wasn't even crunchy :/
-Big b roll - a very dense roll. This roll was so terrible, that everyone at the table made a weird face after they took a bite. We all didn't want to eat anymore. The meat on top was chewy, the rice was super dense and soggy, and the flavor profile was pretty strange, sour and didn't tie everything together. 
-Spider roll - stuffed to the max with rice. A paper thin piece of crab, I think? We really didn't taste it. 
-Baked mussels - severely dry as heck! Typically baked mussels are plump, juicy and topped with Japanese mayo and unagi sauce. This one didn't have any, or if they did, we didn't taste it. It was painful to eat. 
-Miso soup - It came out room temperature and it tasted watery. 
-Plum wine ice cream - it tasted like artificial bubblegum. We didn't finish it. 
-Halibut nigiri - it had a ponzu-like sauce on it and it tasted like a very distinct artificial citrus and smoke flavor. We all agreed that they were mostly trying to mask an older fishy cut of halibut.
-They didn't offer us the fried heads on our ama ebi nigiri (sweet shrimp) - that's the best part! 

We also ordered a volcano roll, but it never made it to us and we were all actually extremely relieved about that. We all didn't want to deal with another train wreck.

For now, we will stick with Naka Sushi or Sakana until something else comes up.",5/26/2014 6:00,36.24209387,-115.2325615,4500 N Rancho Dr,NV,Las Vegas,89130,"Department Stores, Fashion, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Kmart

This is how the sales process went:  we went to the front area and spoke with a lady in customer service.  She got a rep on the floor to help us, who then took us to 5 different registers and then we wound up back at the front customer service area because he could not put the sale through.  

The manager was called to the front to give some type of approval to ring up the sale, and they kept talking about how to put the sale through.  One other representative was explaining why the sale could not be rung up.  When I asked them why it is taking them over half an hour to put the sale through, the manager gave me an attitude and  said he was refusing to sell to me.  I asked him why he had an attitude, then he said you started it.

This was after being in the store for over an hour and waiting for 3 store associates to put the sale through unsuccessfully for over half an hour.  I asked the manager are you refusing a $4,000 sale and he said yes, then walked away.

I have been shopping for years at Best buy and my previous purchase at this specific store was 2 laptops and  2 ipads last Thanksgiving.

I like the drink bar with the schnazzy automated Pepsi kiosk. The bar also had the sauces and utensils available.  The food was decent, I say this because it's not authentic Thai food. It seems more Thai inspired. For example, the Tom Yum soup is basically pho with coconut milk and spice added to it. But it was still tasty!  The Pad Thai was good also, a little on the sweet side.

One suggestion: if you can afford nice plates, forks for silverware and wooden chopsticks, please get some nice soup spoons as well. Those plastic flimsy spoons don't cut it.

I took a helicopter to the Grand Canyon several years ago and it promised a landing in the Grand Canyon with meal, Western shoot out, and the opportunity to ride horses.  Little did I know that I'd see a small part of the canyon itself before landing on a plateau several miles from the river and at a private ranch.

Papillon provided the real thing!  Being a local, I drove to the Boulder City Airport and checked in with Papillon.  I looked around the terminal and checked out some of the gift shop items especially the photographs for sale.

Our pilot, Rob--a fine gentleman and very knowledgable tour guide--made the trip even more pleasant.  We had seen a safety video and Rob reiterated some of the things before we boarded the helicopter.

It was then off to the Grand Canyon with the first sight being Hoover Dam.  He turned the helicopter so both sides had perfect views and photo opportunities.  His descriptions of things were right on.  Being a volunteer at some public lands in the area, I have heard some tour leaders spin false tales about what the tourists are seeing.  Rob was on point with all his descriptions.  Nothing made up, nothing aggrandized for tourists to go back home and tell tall tales to their friends. 

The flight was smooth, the helicopter a thing of beauty, and the flight was perfect with Rob's experience being evident.  Landing a few hundred feet above the river was exciting and a thing of grand beauty.  I wish I had my hiking boots and a half hour to hike to the river and back.

The plaza here has many other restaurants and businesses as well, but the whole area looks so empty and deserted and it smells really bad. But don't let that scare you away from trying this place!

We arrived around noon, and there was absolutely no one in the restaurant. 
We were the first ones there and a few others came afterwards.

They have a large bar in the middle with bar seating, and lots of tables around it.
Great for small and large parties.

We were allowed to sit wherever we wanted which is cool.

They actually have a large variety to choose from on their menu.
Mostly consisting of their popular pasties, which is a pastry with different types of fillings.

I wanted to Peppered Steak pasty but surprisingly they didn't have it or ran out of it, which is weird because this place isn't even busy.

So I got the Cheesesteak Pasty instead. I was very undecided on which sauce I wanted, so the server was nice to give me two options instead of one to try.

I can honestly say that their pasties are DELICIOUS. Tastes fresh out of the oven with very generous portions of meat and veggies. And very cheesy and gooey and yummy. They are a good portioned size as well. You could get full off of one of these without any extra appetizers.

Their pasties range anywhere between $11-$15 each.

tSjaRuV0wtZveJ-l29FITQ,S1uf2BCgKcQET2OmDz0HAA,#NAME?,2,0,0,0,"Overrated in my opinion - at least for now.  Maybe they're still working out their kinks but I was unimpressed overall.  Started with the Salmon Rillettes which were really good - served in a jar with toast points and a small ramekin of lemon curd.  The lemon curd was a great touch and paired nicely with the savory Rillettes.  Unfortunately that's really the last positive thing to talk about.  The service at the bar was anemic and subpar when they were actually around - they seemed more interested in cleaning the bar than actually performing service or talking to their guests ... except for one gentleman sitting at the bar who they must've known since he was the only person to have the bartender engage them out of a 4/5 full bar.  They were very unsure of themselves when I asked a routine question about the ""set"" on which the fish were served - it took three of them to come to a conclusion as to what to say when I asked them to tell me about it.  My entree of Sea Bass was minuscule and I'd feel the same way even if I were in a tapas place.  If the fish itself was 5 ounces I'd be surprised, I'd say more like 4-4.5 oz ... for $40 - I know it's the Strip but that's just ridiculous ( to be fair, everything else seemed reasonably priced considering I was in Aria, as did the fish ... before I knew how tiny the portion was for a main dish ).  Fish and veggies were cooked nicely but severely oversalted.  The dish would've been good had the fish not been too salty and there was more of it but the way it stands I didn't feel there was any value there at all - seriously, it was appetizer sized ( and I'm a local ... I know all about how expensive it is to eat on LVB - this dish had me scratching my head as to whether or not 1.)  more was on the way out or   2.) I had been given and charged for a ""smaller portion"" ... but neither were the case ).  Had the Mac & Cheese ( with lobster and apple ) as a side ... skip it.  It had no backbone - the noodles were overcooked, close to mushy, and retained no sign of al dente and the whole side was super bland and lacked any structure.  That's where the salt could've come in handy.  I had hoped with apple involved there would be some sort of crunch but it was nowhere to be found as the apples were also overcooked, lacking as much backbone as the noodles themselves, and had very little to add to the dish ( Maybe the apples aren't supposed to be al dente ... but again, I was thinking that the snap and ""crunch"" of the apple would provide texture and that was the reason it would be included but there was none of that and almost no taste component added either since I had to seek out the bits of apple to make my assertation ).  Not much lobster in there either but I didn't really expect much for $18 - it was most likely slipper lobster and, again, not much of it.  I did like the idea of the pretzel crumb crust on top of the m&c and that was probably the highlight of the dish but that was the sole bright spot.

The ambiance was decent.  The music was just at the right volume, even a hair more would have been too loud - I like my restaurants as restaurants ... not clubs ... and the DJ who was spinning music for the room was doing a pretty good job.

Again, the Salmon Rillettes were very good but $85 + tip for Salmon Rillettes, salty fish, and bland mac & cheese isn't cutting the mustard.  I will try it again in a few months and hopefully things will have turned for the better.",1/14/2016 8:26,36.119099,-115.175595,3500 Las Vegas Blvd S,NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Shopping, Accessories, Fashion",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Michael Kors

HINTS: We had 3 hints + if you check in on Yelp you get a free one. So 4 total.There are 2 ways to get your hint. You either Y-M-C-A your heart out to a camera and then the Game Master comes in to help you, or you use the tablet that they give you, and you scan the QR codes to get your clue for certain areas. However, the caveat to the latter is that the clues are extremely helpful so when you use it, they cut 5 minutes off of your time. So be mindful of that.

SERVICE: The staff is super friendly, and very informative. They gave us water, joked with us, and took our photos. We asked a bunch of questions about all of the different escape rooms, and they provided a lot of insight on each one.

We've been pretty loyal fans of Wynn/Encore for the past few years, but our last visit there was a little on the boring side.  It was time for a change.

My hb wanted to stay at the Monte Carlo, since we thought we'd catch the Jabbawockeez and looked into the Hotel 32.  If you check their website, they market themselves as the upscale, modern, concierge floor of the Monte Carlo.  It seems to be the trend in Vegas for the older hotels to try to keep up with the modern, skyscrapers of today.  

They boast limo pick up service directly from the airport to the hotel, but as soon as we arrived (20 min late mind you, giving the limo driver plenty of time to get there on time) he wasn't there.  When we called the hotel, they said he was already at the airport waiting for us.  LIARS!! Because as soon as we got off the phone with them, the driver himself called us and said he was on his way.  When he arrived, he was polite and apologetic, but obviously, the hotel just decided to try to cover up some back up.  Not a single drink in the limo.  NOT ONE!!  No champagne!  No soda!  Hell...not even a bottle of water!  

They boast a separate lobby and check in desk, but when we arrived, our bell hop told us that check in was closed and we had to check in at the regular desk. I am no princess, and I didn't mind, but when you advertise that as one of your selling points, then by all means, have it open.  When we arrived at the Hotel 32 floor of  the Monte Carlo, low and behold, a separate check in desk was in fact, open.  WTF?

We booked the studio, and I wasn't expecting a huge room.  Well, it certainly wasn't.  400 sq feet.  Tiny, tiny bathroom with no tub, and no toiletries besides the normal shampoo, etc.  No cotton swabs, no cotton balls, etc.  Damn, I didn't pack those on purpose.  There was no ironing board or iron in the rooms, but you can call for it. Problem is, if you need it the next day, there's no place to store it because the room is tiny!!

Ok, so this goes on and on and so does this review.  So, I'll sum up here...

If you can get a free or really cheap upgrade, then sure, this may be worth it. We asked for an upgrade since the room was a box, and they said we could book the one bedroom suite for an extra $200/night! That would make it $450/night.  That's hardly an upgrade.  For that price, we could book a huge suite at the Cosmopolitan and have breakfast on our private terrace. Considering my hb and I love to gamble, we're throwing that and then some on their tables as is.  

Their lounge that serves a light breakfast and dinner is cool, but the food is definitely not worth it.  I would even call it bad if it wasn't free.  But wait, it technically wasn't free, so yes, it was bad.",2/6/2011 1:03,36.1249276,-115.1354186,"3528 S Maryland Pkwy, STE 120",NV,Las Vegas,89169,"Shopping, Shoe Stores, Fashion",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Shoe Palace

It had been a little running joke between the two of us for years before we were engaged, but it just felt right when we thought about it. The price of a wedding nowadays is absurd and spending that much money on one day when we could spend it on a home or a car seemed unnecessary. 
After looking at what seemed like hundreds of chapels in the area, my husband stumbled upon this one. 
It was quaint and cute and looked identical to a church that our home town is distinctly known for. It was perfect. We were sold. 
We browsed packages available and decided to go for the VIP package. This one seemed the closest to what you would get for a regular wedding at about 1/10 the price. I spoke to a wedding consultant and we had our date set! 
They were so thorough in ensuring the little details were perfect and everything I would want! From entry and exit music, to the flowers, personalized vows, a limo ride to and from the venue, a champagne toast afterwards with wonderful music you can have some slow dances to, a bridal suite to freshen up before the big walk, and a photographer and day of coordinators, they made the day a breeze.

I was quoted $150. This sounded fair, so I agreed to come in Saturday. 
 I dropped my car off Saturday. After it got done, I was told it was going to be $207.00 and my ac wasn't working, and they needed an extra $150 dollars to diagnose it. They also told me I need a new shredder valve because mine was leaking, and this would be an extra $90 plus they'd charge me to refill the system on top of that. I opted not to do that, since I had given them $207 and my AC still isn't working. 
 I got home, looked in my trunk, and saw my new serphantine belt, along with my AC accumulator dryer and orings, part of my kit, were not installed. I called the shop and the man on the phone was very rude and unprofessional. I explained my situation, what I was quoted vs what actually was done to my car. He then when back on what was agreed and told me the mechanic  wasn't going to open up my glovebox to install my kit, for the amount I paid. I was upset because I was told my kit would be installed for the $150, and not only did my compressor not work, my kit was never installed, only the compressor was, and it cost me $207. 
 I told him next time to be more clear with the customer, if they are told they are getting a service, they expect that promise to be fufilled. He then got disrespectful. Said ""There wont be a next time, we wont be doing further business with you, and we covered our asses legally by the invoice i gave you"" At that point I told him that because my whole kit was not installed, if it burns up my new compressor, theyd be liable, he said ""I don't give a shit if it burns up. like i said, we covered our asses with our invoice"" and he hung up on me. 
What I want is either a refund, since I dropped $207 and basically got ripped off, or I want the rest of my kit to be installed along with my AC compressor to work(which I paid for, to be fixed)  I do not trust that front desk employee, who refused to give me his name and talked fowl and disrespectfully to me.",8/24/2014 1:53,36.0739275,-115.1002069,6346 S Pecos Rd,NV,Las Vegas,89120,"Security Systems, Home Services, Home Theatre Installation, Home Automation, Shopping, High Fidelity Audio Equipment, Home Network Installation",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Mike Knows Audio Video

On 12/3/16 I had an urge for Szechuan food en route to Santa Fe Station. Being already familiar with the Chinatown region of LV from a visit to Yunnan Garden a few years ago, I selected its next door neighbor based upon the Yelp reviews.They opened promptly at 11 as advertised and I was the first customer in this clean and sparely decorated restaurant, the most notable decorations being the many blown upon accolades from Los Angeles and Las Vegas publications. 

A young lady brought a pot of green tea to my table. The tea here is exceptional. I really enjoyed it. Those who are unfamiliar with Szechuan and/or Northern Chinese cuisine should take the plunge here. I am familiar with those cuisines which feature great dishes like Mapo Tofu, Cumin Lamb, Fish in Chili Oil and my personal favorite, Sauteed or Twice Cooked Pork Belly with Chili Leeks.I chose the latter.

The Pork dish ($13.99) was very good, although not as good as versions I've had in Manhattan.The portion was extremely generous. The pork was nice and fatty. Szechuan Peppercorns gave the dish a pleasant heat and a nice afterburn., causing me to sweat slightly.There were plenty of Leeks in the dish.It came with a family size crock of white rice(which I had to request......more about that later).Fortunately, there was quite a bit of oily sauce to soak into, and make flavorful, that ample amount of rice.

While the kitchen was fast, there was no further attention paid to my table after my meal arrived, not even a simple ""how is everything?""........and they charged me a buck for the white rice, something I have never seen done in my almost 50 years of eating Chinese food. What's with that?

Despite the foregoing minor carping, Chengdu Taste is a solid Szechuan restaurant to which I would definitely return.",12/14/2016 5:05,36.138943,-115.161629,"2700 S Las Vegas Blvd, Ste 100",NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Shopping, Drugstores",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Cvs Pharmacy

I had the Mushroom Steak on white (added provolone and lettuce) while my guy chose Bacon BBQ Steak on wheat.

My sandwich was tender, super flavorful, moist but not sloppy.

The Bacon BBQ was also flavorful, moist but not sloppy, however the wheat bread is drier than my white by far. I'm not sure if this is due to the particular piece of bread, or if all of their wheat bread is this dry and flaky.

Because we checked in here on Yelp, we got to enjoy a free small french fry. These were nicely flavored and it was interesting to get the option of having fries with our subs instead of the tired old selections of potato chips everywhere else.

We got a fountain drink (coke products, thankfully) but they also offer a cooler full of bottled drinks such as water and powerade if you're taking your feast to-go.

The store location itself is well lit, clean, has nice, bold advertising posters of their delectable offerings, smelled DELISH as soon as we opened the door and had plenty of seating inside as well as a few nice tables for those who prefer to dine outside.

I grew up on Macayo's. My dad was a busboy there when he was a mere 15 years old in Old Vegas. I swear I wouldn't be as tall as I am today without the influence of the TCT (toasted cheese tortilla) and the bean and cheese burrito. I still haven't found an albondigas soup that even comes close to Macayo's. Plus there is nothing like their unlimited smooth salsa with tortilla chips that come at the beginning of every meal. Heck it's so good they sell the bottled salsa at your local grocery store. 

In my adult age, I have learned to enjoy a new aspect of Macayo's: the MARGARITAS. My favorite thing now is to bring my Cha-Cha margarita glass to the bar and have it refilled for $3.99 a glass. Cha-Cha is a ceramic glass in the shape of a Mexican woman and her hat serves as the receptacle for the healthy margarita refills. She originally cost $10.99 with a margarita. 

The service nowadays is a toss up. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's not. They have a pretty good happy hour with discount beers and margaritas if you don't want to go the Cha-Cha route. You have to sit in the bar to take advantage of the half off appetizers. The Shredded Beef Burro Enchilada Style is beyond amazing.

t0R3OFp_RTldw1VYfrVUXg,Hv3vaKQGK71sLei7hQs9og,VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w,4,6,2,3,"LAVO has become our go-to place for bouncing back from serious caloric deficiencies after a weekend of rowdy Vegas partying. The portion sizes here are gargantuan, and so too are the flavors; surprisingly, the prices aren't necessarily so, especially if you're smart about what you order:

_____________

I'm not too sure as to why LAVO seems to take heat from some for the quality of its food preparation; everything that we've had from here has been nothing short of delightful & delicious. 

+ If your server doesn't offer you a basket of complimentary garlic bread, be sure to request it. LAVO's take on the textbook Italian dinner bread has a distinct buttery taste & satisfying initial crunch. The marinara spread offered alongside the bread was also a winner...I'm not ashamed to admit that I shoveled spoonfuls of the sauce into my mouth when no one was looking.

+ We've sampled a handful of LAVO's appetizers in the past, including the delicious Calamari served with spicy marinara. The portion size of this starter is certainly enough to feed 3, possibly 4; it's a whole lot to split among 2 (you're pretty much guaranteed leftovers if you try!). The calamari themselves are crisp, meaty, and tender - some of the best that I've had.

+ LAVO makes a damn tasty wedge salad. The restaurant's take on the classic is much heartier than what I'm used to; big chunks of meaty pancetta are used in place of bacon crumbs, and the creamy bleu cheese & gorgonzola do a great job of offsetting the bold savory flavors of the various entrees. Much like the Calamari, the Wedge is practically an entree all on its own, so come hungry!

+ My GF insists that the Eggs Benedict at LAVO (served during brunch hours only) was one of the best that she's ever tried. I sampled a few bites and was also quite impressed at the perfectly cooked eggs & expertly flavored hollandaise.  We weren't big fans of the accompanying side salad, however...the whole mix had a strong, overpowering onion flavor that rendered it practically inedible. 

+ Don't miss out on the signature Wagyu Meatball; it's as filling as it is fork-tender. I recommend pairing the Meatball with the complimentary table bread, and slathering the bread slices with big bites of Wagyu beef & rich ricotta. Well worth every penny! 

+ I'm pretty confident that a party of 2 can order up an appetizer & two entrees and still get away with having some leftovers to take home. This can really play to your advantage if you order in moderation - for instance, our Wedge Salad, Eggs Benedict, & Kobe Meatball came out to about $65 during our last visit...not too shabby.

_____________

+ You'll immediately notice how pretty the dining area is upon stepping in. It has an upscale, yet inviting vibe that matches well with the overall decor of the Venetian resort. The high ceilings, plush seats, and ornate fixtures set the stage in a classy way that doesn't spill into being over-the-top. 

+ LAVO is home to what I consider to be the coolest restroom sinks in all of Vegas. The foot-operated pump mechanism isn't the most 21st century setup that I've seen, but it's quite fun to operate and makes for a hilarious photo/video op. 

+ Service was attentive, if a little bit scripted. Everyone was polite, but in a forced, by-the-book sort of way (i.e. ""Pardon my reach""). Loosen up, guys! That said, I did appreciate how the waiters promptly switched the channel on the bar TV to air the NBA playoffs per my request. (Evidently, many other male diners appreciated this request - though their wives/GFs didn't look too happy to see them glued to the screen!)

- I do have to dock a star for the lack of men's room upkeep/cleanliness that I witnessed during my last visit. Paper towels & toilet paper were out-of-stock, and there were tissues scattered all over the floors of the stalls. I was surprised to see that there was no restroom attendant - it looked as though the bathroom hadn't been checked up on for quite a while. Not impressed with this, especially considering the premium sort of vibe that LAVO tries to maintain.

I treated my favorite unfiltered dame to a not so quick lunch this afternoon in between her onsite meetings. The overall experience of Ri Ra was exhausting despite the four star reviews. The ticket time was dreadful for starters while watching multiple servers pace back an forward with looks of confusion delivering food. Perhaps their table numbering system is off.    
I ended up inquiring with management about our food after waiting an unreasonable length of time (moments before it arrived). The restaurant wasn't busy on the front end at all.

My ""not so lucky"" white bean veggie burger $12 was absolutely disgusting! I literally left it on the table. This homemade patty texture was terrible and the flavor was even worse. 
My friend ordered the fish & chips $20. This whole filet of Icelandic haddock was massive! The taste was decent; no outstanding bold beer battered flavor to rave about. I did end up sharing the dish due to the generous portion (definitely shareable depending on your appetite). The fries (or chips) were soggy and blah just like the onion rings $6.

They've cut their hair before and know my dogs, they shouldn't change the pricing every time, it's not like they suddenly have different fur.

The atmosphere is very classic trendy with glass and wood accents everywhere. I brought a Bachelorette party here for dinner and though it is a loud restaurant we were a bit too loud for it. Its quite a big space to accommodate for both large and small groups. 

As a vegetarian I was excited to try multiple ""sides"" on the menu. Everyone else order some form of steak or seafood and love it. We had great service and our glasses (wine, champagne or water) were never less than half full. I wish I could tell you more about the rest of the menu but I can only speak for the vegetables. My favorite was the beet salad as the pickled egg was unique. My second favorite was the assortment of mushrooms simply because they were each unique in flavor and basically left alone. I would have really like a sauce of some sort to eat with the fingerling potato and asparagus however. The general team of the sides were too simply for me to say I loved it. Living in Chicago, I have had great side dishes at steak restaurants and I am kind of indifferent about these.

Since they had a special for $39, I couldn't resist and my friend Ian will kill me for not telling him I ate here. I ordered red wine, French onion soup, filet mignon medium rare with a side of baked potato and sauted mushrooms and for dessert chocolate layer cake. 

ROOM CHARGE!

First I had the bread basket with the warm butter and that was delicious and was a good pre-starter before the appetizer. My French Onion soup was good but I had better and my entree was very tender juicy and the two sides was a great addition to the entree.

Lastly the dessert (chocolate mouse layer cake) was very rich indeed with the berry and cranberry on the side of the dish. Yum mee!!

That's The Barrymore in a nut shell. We stopped in for some drinks on a Friday night. At first, it seemed like we picked a terrible night for it--the place was jam packed with a huge group all wearing t-shirts akin to those smut peddlers on the strip. Luckily, their party moved outside to the piano and we seized our opportunity to grab seats at the bar.

After a quick glance at the drink menu, I went for their namesake drink, The Barrymore. I thought it would taste like the Twin Creeks Manhattan thanks to orange marmalade being one of the ingredients. I was right. It was pretty close and I enjoyed every last drop along with every last ice cube.

We went to Olympic Gardens includes two drinks, shuttle there and back to hotel and admission, only downside is we were told $35pp but when we got there they told us the price went up from $40pp we were already there so we didnt complain much (that is not LVGL's fault just saying).

Referred by a friend who thought I should get a second opinion on getting a tooth pulled or a root canal. Long story short. Never got it, although I asked twice. Fee is high, in my opinion($239). Endodontist will only charge about $190 without insurance, Dentist a lot less.  For the cost they will do a 2 hour comprehensive exam. In their defense. I opted not, as I believe much is a scare tactic as to the metal and silver in your mouth.  Although it was a very limited exam they still banged me the $239, and as mentioned I did not get the opinion. He said it's a tough call, and would not commit.  Seems that is why I was there!  He ended the exam by saying they are there for moral support if I need it, and I suppose another $239.  However, I did leave with an estimate of about $10,000.  Go to an Endodontist or a good quality Dentist instead and save your money.

UPDATE:  To be fair, I've found out by chance in reviewing my account here that this office offered a full refund of my office charges-$239.  I would have preferred that they had just sent it out as I don't normally go back and check reviews.  That said, I found it quite fair and nice since nice I did not get what I went in for, and that was an opinion. As I indicated, I was simply looking for an opinion, and not a full exam. In the final analysis, I guess it's moot.  I respect this office for making the refund, which I've received and cashed.

This restaurant has been open for a really long time and I'm surprised that it's so busy. I don't know if this is normal for Mesa Grill or if it was because of restaurant week. Who knows?

Maybe it was because of the food. Everything we had was delicious, each with its own memorable thing.

Appetizers:
-Roasted corn soup- tasty. I enjoyed the hint of avocado and salsa in the center of the bowl. It complimented the soup.
-Blue Corn Pancake with BBQ Duck - the hit at the table. It came highly recommended and one of the signature dishes on the menu. The thin blue corn crepe wrapped slices of AMAZING BBQ duck. And the sauce had a very nice spice to it.

Entrees:
-Lobster Out of the Shell - yummy yummy especially since I didn't have to fight with it getting it out of the shell. The butter sauce was delish (who doesn't love butter?) and the crispy hominy cakes were a nice contrast in texture.
-Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops - mmm. cooked to perfection. Nice flavors and the sauce 
-Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin - the meat was nice and tender and the rub on the outside of the pork gave it a really nice spice.
-Pan Seared Halibut - it didn't taste bad, but it wasn't as memorable as the other dishes.

Side dish:
Double baked potato- had a light horseradish flavor, and overall a good baked potato.

Dessert:
-Pineapple Buttermilk Upside down cake - disappointing. The caramelized rum sauce was very strong and I didn't enjoy it. However, the accompanying pineapple vanilla ice cream was very light and refreshing.
-Creme brulee - a nice large portion topped with fresh berries. A good standard creme brulee.
-Churros- i had high expectations for these since I had just seen Samantha Brown dipping churros in chocolate in Spain. haha.

I can start my review off memories , some blurry because of the alcohol , contact high or simply because I was in a musical orgasm; However it would not be fair for the readers

The place is small. Lets face it. You will end up tasting the sweat of the person right next to you .I can tell you the night before going to a HOB concert I pray to the Gods that the people around me decided to take a shower before the event.

On the flip side..small means close..close means better vibe..better vibe means awesome show! So if you are ok with all that.. it is still a very cool venue specially if you choose to sit on the balcony where there are movie theater kinda seats .

Sound is outdated. Sadly to report they seem to not want to upgrade the speakers nor their (speakers)location. Usually they have to retune , or the sound is simply not that good. The place have a lot of wood which is great for sound..but when you have the same speakers that ""the wonders"" from ""that thing you do"" had..then you are pretty much done.

They are selling food now.Hot dogs pizza , etc. And the price is actually pretty damn good for being inside the venue that is inside a casino. It amazingly tastes pretty good as well(for concert food of course). Food tends to go fast and wait time might be a little long but I think its pretty awesome to have the availability .

Drinks are just ok. Sometimes you get that water downed vodka and cran, but they will NEVER forget to charge you more than 12 dollars for it. Seriously HOB? I mean you are selling 5 dollars pizza but a 12 dollars Barbie sized cocktail? On the flip side..they sell tall boys and that's what I stick with

This place is where its at right now due lack of investment and love from its owners . Music artists don't want to play where they know their concert is not gonna be up to par. People don't want to go to weak concerts and then the whole chain reaction starts.Trust me ;the concept is awesome and I love the feel of a private venue, without the crazy expensive ticket price and with a cool ambiance. Im sure if HOB decides to take care of their spot , all this could change.

To begin, I stayed here in the late 90s and for reasons unknown, hadn't been back since. All of my memories of that trip were wiped with bleach-bit, since I went with my ex-wife. So I started fresh this time around with a completely open mind.

Since I generally stay at MGM places and play poker a lot, I've walked through the NYNY while heading somewhere else literally hundreds of times. (No poker room at NYNY.)  And for a long time, the only reason I had to spend any time there was Il Fornaio. Slowly but surely, NYNY kept adding places I like (Tom's Urban, for example, which is just phenomenal).  

It was time to stay there again, so I booked a Marquis Suite. Looked interesting. Plus the pics showed what looked a 4 person tub with viewing/photography bench, if you're into that kind of thing. 

Check-in service was abysmal. The staff was 50% friendly, 50% incompetent. Not a good ratio. They had the VIP check in blocked off, so we had to check in at the regular desk area. But still, if you're platinum, (a) you probably shouldn't have to ask for the platinum experience at check-in, and (b) if you are forced to ask, the person you're asking should probably have heard of it at some point in their life and not have to go somewhere and ask someone what it is. Finally, if you ask someone to see if a higher floor is available, they should at least pretend to check the computer before telling you no. If nothing else but as a courtesy. Jeez, check your email, whatever. Just pretend you give a crap about my request.

Next, you can't just take an oversized room and call it a suite. That's all the Marquis suite was. A big-ass room with a big-ass tub and a lot of wasted floor space. Things you think of when you say the word suite: Separate living/bedroom area. A place to relax in the separate living area, like a couch. Stuff like that. Like the Delano's suites. Or the Monte Carlo's suites. Or the Luxor's pyramid suites. Or even the Excalibur's suite, which had a second bathroom along with the separate living area. Nothing like that in the Marquis suite. Don't waste your money. Unless, of course, you have 3 other people, a bath bomb from Lush, and a photographer. Then, by all means book this room.

Other things I dislike?  No poker room. Having to wait forever for things like Pai-gow because there just aren't many tables of it. Sloooooooooow drink service at slots. The sports book.

Things I like about NYNY?  The uniqueness of the place. Walking down the hallways in the hotel is like no other place I've stayed. I REALLY like Tom's Urban and some of the other food options. Zumanity. 

It's like watching Hells Kitchen when a chef comes up with a fantastic looking dish, only to hear Gordon Ramsay reject it because it was raw.  NYNY is a beautifully presented dish, poorly executed.",12/9/2016 15:10,36.0983528,-115.2076283,"5010 South Decatur Blvd, Ste H",NV,Las Vegas,89118,"Toy Stores, Electronics, Hobby Shops, Shopping, Local Services, Electronics Repair",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Drones Plus Las Vegas

We chose this location primarily for the access to the strip and the freeways. Check-in is as previously described in reviews with kiosks
Hallways are dark with inadequate lighting, dark colored carpeting and wallpaper.
Our room was newly remodeled but lacked dressers with drawers for clothing. All that was available were two small drawers and a shelf in a closet with a sliding door that also serves as the bathroom door leaving us to store our clothes in our luggage or on the couch...not good. The bathroom also lacked storage except for a 3 tiered plastic shelf
There was some construction noise outside, but not enough to cause a problem. however, earplugs were available in the room.
The hotel is lacking dining venues, perhaps this will change as time goes on. Gone is the buffet and the food court replaced by an overpriced Stabucks

We brought our van to AutoZone and they tested the battery and said the battery seems to be fine and they said it might be an alternator problem because the battery is not charging at all. So I searched on Waze the nearest Honda Auto Shop from where were at and saw Wally's and went there. We brought our Honda Odyssey there and hoping that they would take us in and hoping that they can do the repair the same day. We got there around 2:45pm to do a walk in but didn't really expect that they would still take us in because it was already late and they were also busy. I was in awe because they are very accommodating and their customer service is highly satisfactory! Immediately they took our vehicle for repair, told us the estimate cost and finished it in two hours. Their charges are very reasonable and I am very impressed with their service and honesty.

What a real stink burger of a ripoff place this is!

I had a van that had transmission problems and I brought it here. I admit, I'm stupid. I based this on a coupon they had. Note: ALWAYS make sure they have a good rep. with the Better Business Bureau. At least, make sure they are recommended by AAA, as seen by a label or sign in the window or work desk.

They tried gouging me and saying I needed a major overhaul. I had worked in a shop before. I actually checked out the van. I and a friend of mine KNEW what needed ot be replaced. I even asked my friend without leading him and we came up with the exact same repair solution. They wanted to redo the brakes, electrical, just about every system that had NOTHING to do with the tranny.

So I basically told them that was unacceptable and we knew what the problems were before bringing the van in. He gives me the keys and my paperwork and makes me pay for the diagnostic. 

So we go outside, and the van has a cover inside the van to remove ""the doghouse"" to access the engine under the dash area. It was a GMC Vandura. They basically left everything open and they had a carb cleaner can laying near by. The whole thing was disassembled. I had to put the whole f-ing thing back together! At least it was drivable (albeit in a low gear, the way I brought it there.)

I went to BBB to complain. Thank God, months later, they were involved in a news sting, I believe channel 13? They brought cars knowing what was wrong and similar things happened. A bunch of the shops were closed and workers of the shop were disappearing and all kinds of shenanigans. I do believe the location is closed. If there are any of these sham shops left open, do NOT patronize them! 

Again, I can't do a half or zero star??? If you want to get violent and start throwing pieces of your car in their parking area, by all means bring your vehicle over there.",9/2/2009 6:14,36.0582206,-115.2436309,7155 S Rainbow Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89118,"Art Galleries, Arts & Entertainment, Shopping, Tattoo, Beauty & Spas",,,,,Shopping,,Entertainment,ShoppingEntertainment,Vegas Val's Tattoos

In A Sentence‚Ñ¢
They have chicken (in the form of strips), they are friendly (in the form of they might get their asses fired if they are not overtly faux friendly), and their sweet tea might give you type-II (if you drink it). 

Quick Review‚Ñ¢
+ Chicken is good*. Toast is good**. Sweet tea is good***. 
(*But isn't all chicken?) (**But isn't all buttered toast?) (***But isn't all sweet tea, until you have diabetes that is.)

- Caniac¬Æ Club card is practically useless. Big negative! (/Trump)

------------------------------------------

It is a chain and therefore the food offered should be the same here as everywhere else the company operates. We're not here to discuss the food ....

Although, I must mention here [and in every Cane's review] that the coleslaw is close to inedible. You may think the truth may vary on this account; however, you will be finding that you are sorely mistaken. Coleslaw's nasty. (I bet Cane wouldn't even eat that shit!)

What are we here to talk about then if not the food? 

------------------------------------------

Food
I lied. I'll discuss some food. This is Yelp¬Æ after all! There are a couple of things we can count on around here (Yelp): people who have no business belonging to the ""Elite"" fraternity will be in there, HQ is comprised of incompetent, minimum-wage earning goons who are forced to eat plain rice every day just to continue living, and there will be food (discussed). I digress. 

Strips and a few sides is all they have. If you don't know this already, you might have been raised in a cave, or Alaska (same difference). Strips, fries, the damn 700 calories or so toast, coleslaw that is not fit for mammal consumption, et. cetera. 

Strips are better than other chains. Sandwich made of strips is better than other chains. Sweet tea compels you to get up from your seat multiple times to refill. 

Service
The service at this Raising Cane's is exceptional for a fast food chain. They are usually so friendly, they might even inch out In-N-Out Burger¬Æ for the crown as friendliest service in this category. They take care of you when they mess up. 

Customers
It is so packed here at all times one would imagine that the food is free (or there is no other restaurant in all of Northtown)!

Firsthand experiences: I rode in the back of a motor vehicle filled with dudes -- no, not farm hands but dudes in the colloquial sense -- and walked in through the doors. I stood in queue. I ordered a sandwich. I paid with a Chase¬Æ Credit Card. I filled a cup to the top with sweet tea. I went into the restroom (men's) to wash my hands. The restroom was clean and well serviced despite the immense busyness of the restaurant. I washed my hands. I sat back down. I waited for a short period after that (approximate one minute) to be called, retrieved the tray (with sandwich), filled two little cups with ketchup, sat down, and begin eating. I ate. Et. cetera.

Pro Tip: 
They offer military/service/uniform discount for those uniformed. 
 
------------------------------------------

Tourists: none here+. (+Except when they are driving up the 15 towards Utah and decide to get off to acquire some nourishment in World Famous Northtown.)

Kids: good for them. 

Dogs: good for them++. (++I think there is outside seating and I am pretty sure Cane was a fucking dog, so ....)

------------------------------------------

Rating: Three-stars, ""A-OK.""

Saw the express lane which made me happy as I wouldn't have to wait all day to have my service completed. Well it took about 15 minutes to get checked in. And was told it would be about an hour or so for it to be completed. They seemed kinda busy so I guess that was acceptable. I choose to walk down the street and take care of some things while my truck was being serviced rather than wait in the tiny waiting area. I was not in a rush since I knew it would be over an hour. I returned about an hour and a half later expecting my service to be completed. It was actually another hour before my service was finally completed. 2 1/2 hours for an oil change and tire rotation is far from express. I wouldn't have minded them taking a bit longer on my service if it would have just been communicated to me. But when you use the express lane you expect express service.

When we sat at our table, our waiter came by and checked in with us. He reccomended a couple of dishes which we ended up ordering and not being crazy about. Rather, we were quite dissapointed. Not to mention, the service was also lacking. Considering the bread and oil came out to the table in the middle of our meal and not in the beginning is an example of the service.

PROS:
-easily made reservations via Yelp messenger. found out later that the owner was on vacay so kudos for answering me while in Cali. 
-all seats have an iPad filled with netflix, games and even YELP!
-they are open late, close at 7 m,w,thu,fr,sa/5 sun
-very close to my house
-nail technician was quick and semi-friendly. she also selected a few good nail options for me.
-prices reasonable
-massaging chairs feel amazing.

CONS
-the owner forgot to put my name in the appt book so when i walked in, he treated me like...A WALK IN. 
-my appt was at 6 but all 3 nail technicians were working on someone so I had to wait about 15 mins and the only had one person who could do a pedicure from what he said.
-there was a yelp check in offer for hot cocoa and since i had my kid i thought it would be a great treat for her. so i asked the owner about it and he suggested ice cream instead so i said even better. so we wait, and wait and hes training some girl who made the soaking water luke warm (no bueno). he's just showing her around and chucking it up with her and still no ice cream. luckily my kid had her tablet and the tablet on the chairs. finally when we are about to leave i ask about the ice cream and he's like oh my god did i forget? i get distracted easily. 
-right before leaving as i'm putting my sandals on he asked if i'm zara and i'm like yeah and he admits he forgot to put me down for an appt and he was waiting for me to show up?

Electric Daisy Carnival is an annual electronic dance music festival nightmare held multiple times a year in different locations around the world. So basically, you just saw these people 3 months ago playing the same droning monotonous tracks. Over 350,000 will descend upon Las Vegas as if it's the second coming of JC himself. As wonderful as it sounds for our economy, it won't be what you think. These people don't gamble, shop, eat at fine dining establishments, go to shows, etc and so on. The average age is 17 and for the most part they will get drunk and get high and discard that investment in various receptacles across the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. So why Vegas? We already showcase these DJ's week in and week out as we are the number one nightlife destination in the world. Nowhere in the world are DJ's held in higher regard as they are in Vegas.

My wife and I decided to try Mon Ami Gabs for lunch. We both had the Trout Almondine, excellent! We liked the restaurant and the service so much we came back for dinner after the concert. My wife had the Casareccia Pasta and I had the Classique steak. Not sure how the food came out as fast as it did. My steak was excellent so why the 3 stars? Well, to say that my wife's pasta was uneatable would be a drastic understatement. The truffles were so salty that I (a salt lover) could not eat the dish. So we shared my steak. Accidents happen so the review is not for the salty pasta, no it is for the server and manager. If we had not had the excellent lunch and my steak then this would have been a one star review. As a restaurant owner I do not like giving (or receiving) bad reviews. That is why I have taken so long to post this one. All would have been ok if the server would have cared just a little bit when I brought my concern to her attention. I asked for a manager (because I wanted to treat them as I would like to be treated, that is let them know that if my wife's pasta was way too salty then others may be also) and she simply turned her back and walked away. I paid and on our way out addressed my concerns with who I believed was the manager. It may just be Vegas, but I have never had such a ""I don't give a sh.."" attitude from a server or manager.

Like I said, we were here on an organized bar crawl so we were able to bypass what little line there was for a Tuesday. It seemed busy, but that's because unless you had a reserved booth there was NO where to sit. We made the mistake of trying to go outside (as it's right by the fountains) and were turned away because it was VIP area. Except not a soul was out there. Hokay.....

The people with the booth obviously were there to drop money on bottle service, but if that wasn't your cup of tea - skip this place. Trying to get a drink at the bar ended up not even being worth it. After wandering around in hopes of finding a place to chill, having another member of our group getting threatened to get booted for dancing (apparently not in the right area, and that right area was - you guessed it - in the VIP area!) we happily left. 

It's hyped as ultra fancy but even in the dark, it has a very worn out look. I'd be curious what it looks like in the daylight.

It's interesting how many people do not understand the difference between wet and dry bbq. Barbecue preference is largely dictated by whether you like saucy or seasoned meat  Dry barbecue is smoked, while the wet variety is usually cooked in a fire pit. 
As they say, the secret is in the sauce. Or the rub. And Big Ern uses both which are also homemade. Rubs are typically worked into the meat the night before it's cooked so that the salt can penetrate the cut and tenderize it. But rubs do more than flavor and soften the meat; they also enhance its texture by caramelizing and forming a crispy crust when cooked. Because of the rub's ability to penetrate the meat, fatty cuts like brisket respond well to this type of seasoning. Memphis BBQ is typically a dry barbecue with sauce on the side; in Kansas City and North Carolina, people like their barbecue wet with even more sauce on the side. 

The service is great, and I have been lucky to sit inside on all my visits, because of the temperatures, but, I am sure that the heaters would be turned on, if needed.

The price to some may be steep, however, go to any fast food restaurant and up-size that meal, and see what you'll pay for heart-attack in a box.
I only have one negative remark and it's to Lonely D who reviewed on 12/23, I understand that the holidays may be lonely for some, but one who is unemployed, was a 3 meat combo really necessary, if you couldn't really afford it?

Ok, another remark to Lonely D. Sorry. French fries, really? i just googled Southern BBQ side dishes and the most common sides are available at Big Ern's. Only one out of 10 sites even listed ""oven-fried"" fries, as a side dish. So I guess, the next time you want to take a ""suicidal"" trip, try McDonald's, i hear they have a form of ""rib"" sandwich (now this is not meant for human consumption).

Big Ern's BBQ is small (meaning a one store location), but a HUGE success!!",1/2/2014 4:15,36.2392819,-115.0592898,4350 N Nellis Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89115,"Shopping, Mobile Phones, Drugstores, Food, Grocery, Department Stores, Discount Store, Fashion",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,Shopping,,,Restaurants_FoodShopping,Walmart Supercenter

1GlcztyfdEznRJiKIYl4Ew,0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,sf3kp0H13jZYEmS1A8Etcw,5,4,2,4,"I will fully admit that I don't hide my hatred for over-hyped restaurants on the strip or failed areas of town like Tivoli Village, so it was with great hesitation that I took a few recent suggestions to go try the burger at View Wine Bar. Many restaurants and stores have come and gone from this ghost town of a shopping area, and I question how long anything could survive there based on how few people are around each time I visit. Because no one is ever there I typically assume that this means there's nothing worthy of perusing or devouring here, but after my most recent visit I couldn't be more wrong.

The View Wine Bar is located upstairs in the extremely odd and poorly identified Market LV area of Tivoli; billed as ""something you would find in New York or San Francisco"" this is anything but. They're trying to provide a series of mom and pop style shops in a 'cool' loft style space, but the whole thing seems kind of amateur and is really awkward to walk through. We went on a Saturday and it almost felt like we were accidentally walking into people's private studios or something. The bar itself isn't completely defined, but kind of spills out into the circulation of the market. Too much open space in between slightly oversized tables and chairs flank the 'view' out to the dinky fountain and lovely valet area below. The menu is tapas-style with many reasonably priced, decent sounding items prepared with the ""freshest, seasonal ingredients"" according to their website. Being on a mission, I skipped all the tempting items and ordered the 8oz triple angus burger with tomato jam, lettuce, balsamic onions and additional toppings. You also have the choice of egg, pork belly, bacon, caramelized onions and a few other items that don't sound as good.

I went with the additional pork belly as I'm always a sucker for it, and what came out a few minutes later looked as amazing as it tasted. The meat had really great fresh beef flavor, not much char but delicious nonetheless and cooked perfectly all the way through. The tomato jam had really good sweet flavor, and the pork belly was really tasty and crispy but not quite present enough. I pulled a few bites out to eat separately and enjoyed them, but would probably just skip it next time to save the dollar and enjoy the rest of the flavors on their own. The shredded lettuce and balsamic glaze were a nice touch. The bun was sweet and fresh; possibly the same as Bachi's but maybe a tiny but more dry. Also the bun was randomly a bit too cold when it first came out, but warmed up a bit because of the patty as I was eating. The cheese was melted but not at all noticeable with the strong beef and jam flavors to compete with it. The three different pickles speared to the top were all great, and a nice touch to start off my meal. In all this was a fantastic burger and a total shock based on other meals I've had there recently.

The fries were equally fantastic; thick and cooked well tossed with white truffle oil and a dusting of parmesan. Sadly there were way too few of them, they should almost double their serving size so I don't feel like I'm consciously rationing them through my entire meal. The mustard, ketchup and mayo were a good touch too. While $13 might be a few dollars towards the high end for some folks being an off-Strip location, the quality of ingredients and great flavor of this meal make it completely worth it. I'm almost scared as to whether this restaurant will survive based on how few people go to Tivoli, so I suggest you make your way there to eat this burger and keep this place open until I can make it back again.",3/18/2013 19:25,36.1076857,-115.1860335,"3485 W Harmon Ave, Ste 110",NV,Las Vegas,89103,"Shopping, Musical Instruments & Teachers, Local Services, Computers, Guitar Stores, Musical Instrument Services",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Roman Guitars

They use mesquite wood, not my preference but again that's my preference.  

My only real complaint was the ribs are over cooked. While some people like ""fall off the bone"" ribs, if the bone pulls out clean, it means they're over cooked. They did have a good hint of rub on them. Good flavor but not over powering. 

The brisket had no hint of a rub but the meat has a good flavor. That's what I look for, a meat with flavor without sauce. 

The okra was fantastic and the slaw was good. A vinegar based slaw and not sweet. 

The sauces threw me, being more of a vinegar base and a mustard based. The vinegar again not being my preference is done right.    

The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable about the food they prepare and serve. 

Again my detractors are personal flavor choices not them doing anything wrong or it being bad. What they do they do right. If you blast them for say the sauce, again just because you done personally like it doesn't mean it's bad or they messed it up. You just don't like it. 

If it wasn't for the over cooked ribs I could have given them a 5 star as this is the only thing ""wrong"" with my meal.",3/26/2016 20:02,36.05499,-115.1691065,"7400 Las Vegas Blvd S, Unit 0247A",NV,Las Vegas,89123,"Shoe Stores, Fashion, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Boot Factory Outlet

After eating Pho Little Saigon, we had to try something different. Our friend recommended this place. And yes, I will be coming back if I don't feel like stuffing myself with Vegas buffets. 

We tried #80, which is the beef with lemongrass. You get rice paper, sauces, TONS of veggies (yes...I RIKE!), vermicelli, rice etc. I've never had this dish before and I don't know the name but you cook your own meat and make your own personalized wraps. This way you can judge how much vermicelli, veggies, meat or sauces goes in your wraps.

Service was good too. I usually don't expect the best service at Asian restaurants anyways. I'm so accustomed to nonchalant service that it's second nature not to care. But this place was certainly not the case.

There's a buffet-style bar for veggies and seafood for you to choose to take back to your table and cook as well as another area where you can choose your own sauce.

I understand this place is new, but their greatest downfall was service/efficiency. Orders were constantly sent to the wrong table. We thought it was just our table but seemed to be happening to everyone around us. Tables are numbered, so I'm not sure where the miscommunication is happening. We would get things that weren't ours, incomplete, or just not at all...all night. Our server, Irene, was very sweet though and apologetic.

When ordering meats, you can only order one per person at a time.

I live close by so it's an easy stop when doing the shopping for the week.  So the Mrs and I decided to go after a trip to Wally.  We went the other day and it was right when it switched to dinner and there was many many empty trays of food, which was very disappointing.  They eventually did fill some trays but not all.  We waited and waited and waited some more for them to fill the dessert trays but it never happened so we got frustrated and went to pay and mention it to the hostess.

So we get up there and find out that after we came in that the health department came and shut them down while we were in there so that's why there was no dessert.  The violation was something about food, I think it was pertaining to storage and preparing and it said right on the violation that they had been warned before.

So I guess the claims of people getting food poisoning are true and we were just lucky.  The worst offense to me was that they charged us the full price over 10 bucks a person even though we didn't get to really eat very much!  Not only that, I'm confused why the health department didn't come into the eating area and tell everyone.   

So in a nutshell... eat at your own risk!   They lost me..

This restaurant is beautiful.  The decor is light and upscale, but also feels comfortable.  I liked the waiting area (though it is a bit small) and especially appreciated the complementary photo booth - what a unique experience.  We were seated for our 9:30PM reservations right around 9:30.  Though we didn't get a seat right by the window, we could see the skyline pretty well.  There really isn't a BAD seat in the restaurant.

Our waiter, Rocco was nice.  He was very classy and offered us suggestions on what to order.  I did at some points though out the meal feel out of my league in this ""fancy"" restaurant, but overall I felt welcomed.  The prices here are pretty high, but in line with other ""nice"" restaurants in Vegas.  I found the portions to be pretty decent... some smaller than others, but overall adequate.  Drink prices were very steep, as expected for a posh Vegas hot spot.

The Hubs and I decided to share a few things.  We had the bacon wrapped, sausage stuffed dates.  Yum.  Soft, sweet, spicy, these gems had it all.  Highly recommend.  For our entrees we got the lemon spaghetti and the veal chop.  The lemon spaghetti, though everyone RAVES about it, was a bit underwhelming.  The shrimp it comes with are HUGE.  I think I would have preferred a few smaller, regular sized shrimp.  The dish was lacking something... maybe some pepper or parm topping... not sure, but it was just ok.  The veal on the other hand was amazing.  It was huge and melted in your mouth.  So good... I would for sure get this dish again.  For dessert, even though we were stuffed, we shared three cookies, lemon, peanut butter chocolate, and chocolate chip.  The lemon was amazing as was the peanut butter.  The chocolate chip one was just ok... I'd say get two lemon next time.

The entire party walked away happy with their meal and experience.  I'd go back again in a heartbeat and try out some of the other pastas and appetizers.

The room is immaculate has a dinning room, living room, mini kitchen bar area and the bedroom with a huge master bathroom. 

Being that there was just two of us, we did not need all the extra space, but it was very nice and had great views of the strip. 

We loved the Sky Suites pool area separate from the large pool, had pool side service and nice shaded chairs. One nice thing would be great if they had an adults only Sky Suite pool.

We definitely love Las Vegas and will be back, just have to see who has the best deals to house us next time.",9/21/2017 0:31,36.0145972,-115.1171168,"9550 S Eastern Ave, Ste 130",NV,Las Vegas,89123,"Books, Mags, Music & Video, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Psychic Eye Book Shops

I was sooo looking forward to the savory experience that everyone is bragging about here, but I walked away feeling empty and confused.

My burger order looked like something that came out of a low-budget public school cafeteria. It was slapped together quickly and didn't appear like anything I've seen posted on Yelp. It felt diminutive in comparison. It was a mess to eat, as the bun was already soggy in the 50 feet I walked to sit down. I could taste some good flavors in the burger/sauces, but they were blurred as I fought to keep all the parts together. I ordered jazz fries, but received regular fries because of an apparent typo. The fries were also cooked unevenly. Not anywhere worth $9.00.

Saddened sigh. I tried to determine what factors might have contributed to my experience, but really couldn't rationalize anything.

My most recent experience was amazing only because our server Jovanny was outstanding! Although he had 3-4 other large parties to tend to he always came by to our table and made sure we had everything. He's the best server I've ever had not just at this place but in general. He made us feel welcomed and always took care of us despite his manager Linette who didn't make our last visit so good. We would order drinks and she wouldn't let him serve us drinks then proceeded to tell us they were out of a specific drink we ordered but then we were notified that she had lied for no reason in particular. So when Jovanny had served us our requested drink she proceeded to lecture him in front of us even though Jovanny did nothing wrong but serve us. She was merely upset at the fact that she was wrong for lying but used her title as manager over him. If it wasn't for Jovanny's excellent service I would've gave a low rating but he made a bad experience into a great one simply because of his service and personality.

Now for the best - when I finally, on the last day of my stay, went to Libertine Social shortly after they opened for the evening. The bartender was friendly, attentive and accommodating even though I only drank water while I asked for his recommendations and then ordered and waited for my take-out order. For $14, the Libertine burger (for happy hour) came with fries. I took it up to my room.

The burger  was a two-patty, succulent, decadent delight. The generous side of fries was hand cut, tasty, and mostly crispy (not wedges as some have described, but what I think of as traditional fries. They probably would have retained more crispiness if I hadn't taken them to go).  Libertine included big sides of ketchup, an aoli-ish mayo, and a jaw-droppingly delicious Bordelais sauce. Dip a fry in the Bordelaise and then the mayo, eat, swoon, repeat. Pour the sauce into the burger and take even a small bite. Die happy.

Did I mention that Libertine was great? LOL. Other than the always reliably fabulous Hot Mess roll and great customer service at Kumi, the Libertine burger was the highlight of my dining at Mandalay Bay on this trip.

We went on a Friday night on the late side, about 8:00 pm. The restaurant is decorated okay, it has booths, and tables but it's strangely laid out, the dinning room is on the small side compared to the huge bar area and it has a bit of a cold feel to it. The restaurant was half full and we were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait for a table or we could sit at the bar and eat with no wait, we opted for a table but went to the bar for a drink. The bar has plenty of seating and multiple TV's. The bartender was nice and waited on us quickly. I had a beer and my husband had a well cocktail. The drink prices are on the high side, it was $5 dollars for my draft Miller Lite, I think that's high, they did have a beer special but we weren't told about it until after we were done ordering. 30 minutes later we were seated in a booth. It took our server longer than it should have to come to the table so we had already looked at the menu and decided on an appetizer. We ordered the Pepperoni Stuffed Cheese (which was the one the reviewer raved about), the waiter told us they were out of them as well as our 2nd choice which was the Arancini. We told the waiter we were pretty disappointed and he replied with "" sorry, this is my 2nd job and I'm just trying to make a few extra bucks, we didn't know our review would be in today's paper and we had two big parties come in."" He pointed to the two tables, one was a party of 10 and the other was a party of about 8, other than those two tables there were 3 parties of two each including us.... that doesn't seem like enough business, to run out of your signature items. A table of two near us ordered sandwiches for dinner and were also told they were out of whatever it was they ordered, pretty disappointing. We ended up ordering the Garlic Knotts,a half caesar salad, husband had Chicken Parmesan and I had pasta with Rose sauce. The food took forever, the waiter kept saying he was sorry and as soon as the big parties leave our food should be up next. It took 35 minutes for any food to arrive and when it did, it all came at the same time, something we just hate. The Garlic Knotts were fine, nothing special, they come with Marinara sauce for dipping which was good. Ceasar salad was good, lettuce was cold, fresh and the dressing was very good, not a ton of dressing but I don't like my salad drenched so it was fine and the half order was the perfect size. My pasta with rose sauce was OK, the pasta was a bit overcooked but that's not a big thing to me, the sauce which the waiter had told me was a ""light"" cream sauce (menu says it's Marinara with a touch of Alfredo) was not light and it was a bit oily, where you could see the oil around the edge of the bowl, flavor was not bad, but I would say it was more Alfredo with a touch of Marinara. Husband's Chicken Parmesan was not good at all. I'm surprised at the other reviews that say how good it is... we are Italian and maybe that's the difference, I don't know. The chicken was a big, thick piece of chicken with flavorless breading, covered in melted cheese and sauce....Chicken Parm should be a nice cutlet of chicken with seasoned breading, sauce and not buried in cheese, you should be able to taste the chicken cutlet not just a gooey mass of cheese. Our bill for two with tip was $91... not crazy expensive but there are other Italian places (Ventano's - Tuscany Grill) with great food for as much or less. So, between the wait for the table, the high beer price, them being out of the appetizer's we went there for and the marginal wait service, we will not try them again. . This is the second time we have tried a restaurant our local food reviewer recommended, both were Italian and both were not good, I don't think we'll go with her recommendations anymore.",1/12/2015 20:08,36.052392,-115.1690207,7400 Las Vegas Blvd S,NV,Las Vegas,89123,"Shopping, Fashion, Shoe Stores",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,G H Bass

Started with the country p√¢t√© and the foie and duck confit gateau. The p√¢t√© was creamy and had a lot of flavor. Spread it on the brioche toast points they give you with some of the Dijon, radish, watercress, and cornichons, Delicious. The gateau was really good. It was layered with duck confit on the bottom, foie mousse in the middle, topped with a blood orange gelee. Also had a blood orange gastrique on the plate, it was really, really good. It was on the Valentines Day menu. The wife's favorite dish of the night.

Second course was a potato leek soup and an endive salad. The soup was creamy and delicious. The endive salad had an awesome walnut vinaigrette that went very well with the endive and the bleu cheese. 

Entrees were phenomenol.  The wife had the steamed mussels with chorizo and fennel with a side of frites. The mussels were very fresh and the broth was very flavorful. I had the short rib Bourgogne with hand made pasta and glazed root vegetables.  It was the best short rib I have ever had. The flavor was deep, the veges were cooked perfectly and the pasta was fresh. The best thing about the whole dish was the sauce, so rich and flavorful.

This was, a simple project that had problems. All projects have problems. That's life. The way in which your company responded to the problems was the failure.

Pickup was so easy and most of the paperwork was done ahead of time. No issues during my trip seeing how the coach was brand new. 

I didn't mind because I already had everything, but I saw another review that mentioned this... you are renting only the RV. ANY necessities like linens, towels, soap, etc you will need during your trip are not included. You can purchase/rent some items from El Monte or purchase elsewhere. Nothing a quick trip to walmart can't remedy though.

Drop off was even easier. Just a quick walk around, some paperwork and done in about 15 minutes. I rented in February. I'm amazed at the amount of reviews saying the wait was long.

I first discovered this place in 2000 when my dad took me to the Philippines.  Jollibee was all over the place!  I didn't quite get the weird hamburgers.  I didn't quite get the fried chicken and gravy.  But then.. it clicked!  I got the Filipino Spaghetti.  I got the pies..  and then I was turned onto the fried chicken.  Silly me.  

The Jollibee fried chicken is just like my mom would make at home with steamed rice.  The gravy from Jollibee, tastes like its made from a powder, was good with the chicken.  I was converted!  I was, dare I say, turned on.. by the chicken!  

Now, my 2 daughters and I go to Jollibee when we're at the Filipino market, or we're looking for the homestyle fried chicken and steamed rice.  They also make a yummy Pineapple Quencher..  Mango Peach pie..  YUMM..  And the Langka pie.  Get 'em and Eat 'em while they're fresh and HOT!  They're made the same way McDonalds used to make their apple pies back in the day.

Pros- huge, clean room. beautiful bathroom w/  separate tub and shower.  Also, I really like how the grounds are decorated; has alot of plants and a water fountain. 

Cons- The pool is pretty big and beautiful but there are simply not enough lounge chairs. We were out there pretty early and had to fight for a spot. Only saw the cocktail waitress once when we were out there and she didnt come any where near us. 

I didnt check out the casino or any restaurants so I cannot comment on that. The guys at the valet are nice and friendly. Front desk was friendly....

However, they advised that they were going to hold a $100 deposit on my debit card for 24-48 hrs...which is totally fine with me; that is standard at any hotel. Normally the charge stays on my card for a few days as a pending charge and then drops off. But today I checked my bank account and the charge was no longer pending...it had actually been charged!! I have never seen this before and I do not think it will drop off once it moves from pending to charged. So...I promptly called the hotel and was told I would have to speak with accounting but they are not there right now so I will have to call back some other time!! This is very bothersome to me as I travel alot and i am used to the deposit staying on for a few days but I have never been charged for it before.

I know, ""you go to LV to play pinball?!?"" The answer is yes, yes I do. It is every pinball junkies dream to find a dimly lit, air conditioned hall, with all types of vintage and modern pinball machines. Most of the machines play for a quarter and if you need help with lost change they are very friendly in the back. 

Not everything is pinball, they have some arcade and racing games. They even have a Whack A Croc game in the back. 

Pros
Pinball housed in 10,000 square feet!
1950's to 1990's pinball machines
60's, 70's, and 80's pinball machines are prevalent
Popcorn from the vending machine for 50 cents
Yoo-hoo and other treats are available for sale
Non-profit, all excess proceeds go to charity. Imagine, gaming benefiting charity! 

Cons
None, other than the Pinball Hall of Fame being too far away for most of us

Just go, take the kids. I wasn't around for most of pinball history but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate and love it!

On this and previous vacations here we have enjoyed eating our breakfast al fresco at the pool cafe. However, with the addition of the City Center complex and thanks to a line at the pool cafe we have found a new favorite for breakfast at Silk Road in Vdara. It is simply one of our very favorite places for breakfast EVER!!!  

We just ate there the past three mornings-phenomenal!  I can't say enough good things about it and the waitstaff- a different one each day and they were all The French press coffee is smooth and perfectly brewed.  We had omelettes the first day with pastries and the tropical fruit. The omelttes were solidly good and the tropical fruit excellent with beautiful presentation and a decadent side of sweet tahini yogurt. There was even a half of a fresh lilikoi (passion fruit)!  

The second morning we again shared a continental breakfast with pastries, juice, and coffee along with the tropical fruit.  I chose the morning sliders-two small tenderloin sandwiches and a third sandwich as a take on bacon, egg, and cheese all on brioches. Wow!!!  My husband had the turkey hash which was also fabulous!  It is a hash of turkey and potatoes but with an alluring blend of Turkish spices and topped with two eggs.  Soooo tasty! 

This morning we had the same as yesterday except I tried the signature Eggs Eggs Eggs dish and my husband opted for egg whites scrambled on top of his hash. The Eggs Eggs Eggs dish is a trio of takes on classic egg dishes-a poached egg atop the turkey hash topped lightly with hollandaise, a fried quail atop a tasty fried (but not greasy) potato cake, and scrambled egg served in a shell upon steamed spinach all topped with a light salt foam.  Oh boy!!!  

Overall everything was get-it-again worthy.

Supposedly needed a whole bunch of new parts, when I called to ask them specifically what the parts were ie suspension system fe1 fe3 or fe5 they couldn't tell me because they didn't know, when I asked if it was four wheel or 2 wheel ABS they guessed it was four wheel and also when I asked him what control arms need to be replaced upper the lower they were like it only has 2 so I think the lower?

Went to O'Reilly's to buy the wheel hub $109 plus tax, pulled the wheel off replace the old hub noticed the old hub have had a broken wire, fixed the problem.

-Beef tartare, a little creamy and spicy from the kimchi, interesting, not my favorite
-Roasted Salmon, nicely crispy skin, like BLISTERED, like a kettle chip, loved, sides are big and can get a bit vinegary and repetitive
-BBQ Foie Gras, rich fatty goodness, paired with blueberries and peanuts
-Blueberry Pie, great crystalized crust, topped with lemon thyme ic and not too sweet
-Strawberry Sticky Cake, really good, must order, on the sweeter side

Very nice lobby and friendly staffs. A man made grass area is available for your furry babies to take care of their business in front of the hotel; turn left and walk for a minute after you exit the hotel lobby.

We booked the most basic room. It is spacious and clean and well decorated. Double door to the corridor that reduce corridor noise. Large bath room with a shower and a jacuzzi. Double sink in the bathroom and bulletin TV in the bath room.

Microwave, electric hot plate, small refrigerator and a sink is in the room. Plates, bowls and utensils are available per request. Great to have to heat our furry babies meals up.

We had a king bed and the room also has a 3 seat-er sofa, 2 single sofa, a decent size desk and a chair; spacious.

Free Internet access (Wi-Fi and Wired).

Valet and in room service could take time which is about the same for any hotels we have stayed.

Otherwise, can't complain.

You enter through Paris Hotel and Casino and there is a round Chunnel like structure, which the Door Girl explains transitions you from Paris to England.   Then she pointed out the red neon overhead light sculpture which is to simulate Gordon's hand movements while making Beef Wellington.   All kind of scripted but sets the tone that every aspect of your experience has been well thought out.   We were seated in leather high back chairs at our table.  Very comfortable.   Matthew, our server, and his  waiter assistant provided spectacular service.  We were very impressed.   The only single and very minor disappointment is that the oil drizzled bread was a bit dry.   But that is the only single negative thing we can say.   And keep in mind, there were three choices in bread so, very minor.    I was having dinner with my boss, who is a seasoned fine dinner.  She very much enjoyed herself, as did I.  We started with the pork belly.   Yum!   I decided on the fish and chips because if anyone could pull off a unique twist on fish and chips you would think it would be Ramsey.  And he did.     My boss got the short ribs which fell apart to the touch.   They were phenomenal.    We order mac and cheese as a side.   We both had to take a moment and just close our eyes to enjoy.    When our server's wait staff assistant came to clear out plates, we told him it was too soon, like after you open all your gifts at Christmas and there's wrapping paper and ribbon all over the place, you just want to relax and take it all in for a moment.   He laughed and came back later.   We didn't have room for desert but I'm sure it would have been terrific.   We drank patron margaritas and there were well portioned with alcohol.  After three we were ready for a long winter's nap.   Kudos to the staff at the restaurant.    There was one moment when I had a question and raised my hand to look for my waiter, but was quickly seen to by someone else's waiter.   He came right over to see what my need way.   Can't beat that.   He was eager to ensure our experience didn't involve any delays.

We like sushi and various types of asian cuisine, so we thought it would be worth giving it a shot.  Boy, we were mistaken.  The server was nice, but the service itself was awful.  We decided to try the all you can each sushi, only to find out that there were few specialty rolls available for the all you can eat menu (those on the regular menu were quite overpriced, btw).  To put it simply, I have never had such a lengthy sushi experience.  It took us literally 20-30 minutes to get one or two rolls.  Ridiculous.  Not to mention, the sushi itself, tasted average at best, and both my girlfriend and I had stomach aches later (we eat sushi regularly).  Additionally, they mistakenly put eel in one of my rolls, which made me pratically gag, as I am not a fan of eel and I specifically asked them to leave it out.  75 dollars later, we were both terribly disappointed.

She had in the 11 years clarified her wishes. She was to have an Open Casket Vigil with a Full Catholic Funeral to be followed by cremation, as she had paid for. Laurie, the assistant manager ended up helping us. She was rude from the get go. Half of my family is LDS so I understand not working on Sunday. For every work around her answer was a RUDE NO!  Short of having my mother's body transferred to another mortuary there was no way we could practice our religion because of her bigotry. She got to sit smug at her stakehouse last Sunday while my family was in misery, unable to worship in our manner. Just know if you use La Paloma your family's freedom of religion may be stifiled. On the up side, Palm Mortuary took my cold call without batting an eyelash. I was comforted, made the best arrangements I could and was done in less than an hour. I give 10 stars to Palm!

P.s. I heard back from the GM via email. He attacked me for being upset about my mother's death. He tried to instill discord among me and my siblings. I did tell them to cremate my mother's body as that was the only way she could be at her own funeral. He then stated I yelled at Laurie, the assistant manager when I went to pick up her ashes. There was no one else in the front room except my mom's doctor to make sure the death certificate was ready. She was witness to the whole exchange. I simply said that Palm Mortuary was able to finish my fairly extensive out of pocket order and I would never work with them again. I was calm and left wishing her a pleasant afternoon.

The Mirage needs some serious management training and leadership skills in customer service. I was staying there for the Digital Auto Dealer Conference in early Oct 2011. Here are the ""low lights"" of my stay:
1. Called ahead to ask for early check in. I was told no problem. When I got there, they actually laughed at me and said ""no chance.""
2. I had to stow my bags with the bellman so I went to the ""Bell Desk"" to do that and they acted like I was bothering them and then pointed that I should go outside to do that.
3. Once in my room, I called the bell desk several times to retrieve my bags, getting an automated attendant and COMMERCIALS! while I was waiting for someone to pick up. It took 4 tries to get someone on the phone and once I did, Cynthia laughed at me when I told her the substandard experience I had just received. I actually asked her, ""Are you laughing at me?"" but she didn't reply.
4. Whenever you call any dept in the hotel, they don't know your name. They ask you every time to state your name, making me feel unimportant.
5. Most every hotel these days has an in-room coffeemaker. Mine didn't so I called room service. I like to have hot water in the mornings so I asked about it and they said I would have to order hot water from room service! Really???
6. I did like they said, I ordered hot water from room service and guess what?  It tasted and smelled like coffee!
7. There was no shower cap (I know this is a small one but to those of us with long hair, it's a big deal).
8. The rooms are dirty, they need a makeover.  Appalling.
9. After I checked out I had time before my flight so I asked where in the hotel could I work for a few hours without any cigarette smoke (since I am allergic).  I was told the only place in the hotel where there is no smoking was Starbucks.  Thank you Starbucks for being the only bright spot in my stay at the Mirage.
10. I had to visit the ladies' room during my Starbucks stay and had to walk far into the casino to get there.  When I did, there was no toilet paper in ANY of the stalls.
With that, I called a taxi and left for the airport early.  DO NOT stay at the Mirage Hotel.

+Food: Brunch with a little twist.  Very good.
-Huevos Motulenos: This was my least favorite of the things we ordered.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't very memorable.  Sauces were nice, eggs were cooked well, plaintain was a nice surprise but overall it was okay for me.
+Cinnamon Biscuits: Plated really beautifully with berries and warm strawberry compote.  The biscuits were fluffy and delicious and the compote had just the right amount of sweetness.
+Corned Beef Hash: If you're a corned beef type of person, it's the right dish for you.  It wasn't overly salty, it was cooked well and crispy, eggs were perfection.  Also the fluffy sourdough was just awesome to eat with it.

+Price: I think it was affordable (~$15+ a person)

+D√©cor: Very cute and hipster.  

+Wait: Wasn't too bad actually.  I expected a huge wait on a Sunday but for 8 people, it was about 30 minutes.  The food came out very quickly as well.

Overall, I'd definitely eat here again.

Glen was always on time and we have had no issues. After having people over and us going in and out from the yard to the house we noticed the sliding screen was a little hard to pull. I contacted Glen yesterday about it and he replied right away and said he'd come take a look. He just left and fixed the issue (nothing major or fault on the screen at all) we must have pulled too hard and it came off the rail.

I was really excited to try this place after reading mostly good reviews on Yelp, but have been seriously disappointed. My nails are throbbing from over drilling/ filing and have been filed down to the quick, 2 cuticles are super raw from tearing away with cuticles scissors. 
First, probably my fault for not canceling this appointment after the texts throughout the day asking me over and over to change times. First I had made an appointment at noon, then an hour and a half before my appointment Kamille asked if I could come at 3:30. I said sure, I would go pick up my kids early so I could make her new time. At 3:15 she texts me asking can I come at 4? At that point I should have just canceled. Who has time to rearrange their schedule like this? I arrived at 4, Kamille showed up 5 minutes later with her daughter. Her daughter was extremely sweet, but Kamille had what looked like her swim suit top, so I was wondering if they were at the pool and that's why she couldn't make our original time.  
Then after requesting over the phone when making my appointment and in the texts back and forth that I wanted gel manicure, Kamille then realizes they don't have the gel top coat needed to do a gel manicure! I felt like so far, the twice rescheduled appointment, now the right materials needed to do the service we discussed are not available??? I should have just left, but you know when you're in a weird situation and you just keep going with it? You're worried you'll seem inflexible and I thought back to the good reviews on Yelp, so I figured my nails would turn out looking good. Kamille said they do this technique that is similar to gel polish, but better. I said okay I'd try it. 
After she took an electric drill to my naked nails, she applied the first layer of the special product. In the UV light it burned like a mother, but Kamille said that was normal. It was NOT a great feeling and I can't imagine doing that twice a month. 
Top it off with a chunky, bulbous goo that hardened into a super thick, super unattractive mass on top of my nail which looks like I have swollen nail beds. It is jagged/slanted on two nails like a file was pressed hard against it while still wet, there are 3 glitter black dots on my thumb nail, and chunks throughout the rest. It was not flat or smooth like my 200 gel manicures before, and no matter what fantastic product it is, if your fingers are throbbing from over drilling and the finished look has fat, wavy, hard polish/product on your cuticles or your fingertips that you can't peel or rip off, if it looks like my third grader painted my nails and it feels like my fingers have been slammed in a door, it's NOT a good thing. 
I don't want my money back, and I hate leaving negative Yelp reviews, I see the mom gets awesome reviews, but after this experience I reread the reviews for this place tonight, there's a few similar reviews from others about Kamille. I think she was super nice, but my fingers have NEVER been as sore as this from any manicure, and I've tried lots of different kinds from lots of different technicians.  My concern is I can't soak these off, I can't just peel it off, it will have to be drilled off (I asked Kamille how would I ever get it off should I choose to, she said only drilling).  
Honestly, the place is super cute and kitschy, but I will not be returning. I am going out of town this weekend to my old salon where I texted my old nail lady the pictures of my fingers, she also has started doing this technique (along with regular gel polish and other types of manicures) and she showed the other nail techs in the salon, they were appalled and couldn't believe how terrible they looked... They are going to TRY to file some of the thick layer off, but are worried that it'll further damage my nails. Really??? Absolutely ridiculous I might be living with this for awhile.",6/21/2013 14:05,36.09564,-115.176264,3900 Las Vegas Blvd S,NV,Las Vegas,89119,"Jewelry, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Pearl Factory

There are about 3 levels of tables in this restaurant. My fianc√© and I were seated on the middle level with views overlooking both the level below us and the level above us. Our server (I believe his name was Henry) was absolutely excellent! He took the time and didn't seem rushed or overwhelm when I asked for recommendations. He was genuine and it seems like all of the servers are great there!

We received this deal online which made our dinner a little cheaper, and we ordered calamari as an appetizer. It was unique and flavorful. We ordered the filet as our main along with a few side plates (fried onions, au Gratin potatoes) I ordered my filet medium well, and my fianc√© ordered his medium. They both came out perfect and juicy. It was amazing, however I was disappointed at the size of the side plate portions, specifically the fried onions, we could not even come close to finishing the side plates because the portions were large.

I have to say it is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. We arrived a little early for our reservation, so we began with drinks at the bar. We each had one of the drinks on their happy hour menu, Raspberry Lemonade. They were very tasty, with just enough alcohol that we returned for the happy hour the next 3 nights in a row to get more!

Once at our table, we received an order of the Duck Fat Fries, compliments of the chef. The fries were as great as you can imagine. Deep fried in duck fat, in 3 different styles, with 3 different sauces. I was trying not to eat too many because I didn't want to fill up and not eat my meal, but I could barely bring myself to stop eating them.

My girlfriend and I each got the 10oz Kobe Beef Filet Mignon. The waiter informed us that the beef is poached in clarified butter, then finished on a mesquite wood-burning grill. It was literally the best steak I have ever eaten. 

There is a great selection of appetizers and sides to choose from, very difficult to decide. We ended up going with the Truffle Mac and Cheese, the Roasted Artichokes with Goat Cheese, and the Chipotle Scalloped potatoes with Queso Fresco. All were so tasty, but I think my favorite was the Artichokes.

The atmosphere was perfect for a couples dinner. Our waiter, Sean, was very attentive to all of our needs and provided us with excellent service. 

The place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for. Great service, and amazing food and drinks.

Its a Vegas nightclub, a pretty great one by the way.

find a promoter - not hard, get on instagram, look up the club name, scroll through the pictures, you will find promoters for that club.

Text them - tell them you girl/guy count (should be more girls than guys, just the way it is) they will put you on their list.  you show up probably an hour before you wanted to (say 1000-1030) and you wait in line for less than an hour and get in for free.  Bring drinks and drink in line, its Vegas.  Want to show up at midnight? Awesome, add an hour to your wait and pay 50 bucks each.  Its not a surprise.  If your promoter is going to actually be at the club shake his hand and slip him a $20 to say thanks.

inside, yeah its crowded.  Pretty sure the max occupancy number incorporates the floor space made up by the booths, but we have never had an issue.  yes sometimes security doesn't let people on the dance floor.  don't give them crap.  Its not their choice. their boss told them to.  Its their job. Simply walk around to another one of the dance floor entrances.  over the course of four hours there was never a time where at least one of the entrances wasn't ""unguarded"" or at least you could walk by if you looked like you knew what you were doing.  The entrance by the bathroom was the easiest one.

Yes drinks are expensive.  Pre-party. Show up a little early and save the cover to pay for booze.  Pot is legal in Vegas, go buy some gummies or something.  

just have fun.

Omnia rocked.  the cold air blasts were welcome relief from the crowd but we had an awesome time dancing with everyone.  and it was real dancing. couples, groups, occasional entire dance floor jump up and downs.

I placed my order for pick up and as I pulled into the lot a lady was sitting on the curb approached me. 

She was someone who probably doesn't get a meal as frequently as most and quietly asked me if I could give her my leftovers after dinner and didn't want any money. 

I went into the restaurant to get my soup and half of a sushi roll and asked the server if I could leave money for the lady outside so she could pick her meal and actually be able to sit down and eat it. A bald man who was another server chimed in and was like no you can't do that, she'll bother other customers, that's what they usually do. It's better if you get her something to go. 

I will not be returning to Osaka. That man had no humanity or compassion in him. If that's the type of people that work there, my business is not needed.

The ambiance of the place was soothing. Dim lights, quiet (although it would be nice to add some sort of soothing music or calming sounds to block out the employee's conversations with one another). 

Now, let's get to the reason why this review was given 2 stars. My boyfriend decided to do the $20/hr massages. As the massages started from the head to the neck, I'm not going to lie, it was quite relaxing. There is a very loud wind chime on the front door, which I feel is very unnecessary and distracting. It took away from the soothing and quiet ambiance. Then our masseuses moved to our arms and starting beating the crap out of our arms. Went downhill from there. When my masseuse massaged my feet, it almost felt like she was scratching my feet more than massaging them. It was painful. And they spent nearly 30min on just our lower extremities. I was hoping for a more focus on my back and shoulders. Which they only spent 10 min on. I was then asked to turn around. So here I am, face down, and this lady jumps on my back and puts her entire body force on me. I mean, it wasn't bad, but I was not expecting it. I should have at least been warned. My boyfriend, on the other hand, had a male masseuse and was definitely not used to the deep pressure. The dude also put his whole body force on him. 

I've never felt so unrelaxed during a massage in my life. I was in more pain than anything. 

When it came to paying, we paid for the massage and we even tipped despite the fact that we felt we shouldn't have. But the masseuses insisted on more tip.

After leaving and getting to our next destination, I was shocked to notice a popped vein on my arm (pictured in this review). I know I did not have that before I walked in. Pretty unhappy about the experience, but I guess that's what we get for paying for a cheap massage.

We haven't really used the cards much, other than for a couple of subscriptions - so we haven't bothered increasing our credit lines any further.

However, what it HAS done is allowed us to get standard cards with other companies.

The annual fee is annoying - but there are few no-fee cards any longer, and at the premium credit card level, you're looking at much higher annual fees (like United club cards with $450 annual fees).

My family and I decided to show up for brunch on Sunday April 28, 2019 knowing there would be a wait since there was 10 of us. We signed in and was told there was a 40 min wait. We decided to wait. An hour later my boyfriend approached the hostess and asked how much longer and she said 30 min. I got impatient and approached the hostess stand 10 min later and asked how long was the wait, the hostess proceeded to tell me that there were waiting on one table to leave, ONE! The place is huge and they we're waiting on ONE table to leave?! Wow! 
She said it was going to be another 40 to 45 min before they sat us and that the kitchen was backed up another 40 min so even after they sat us the wait was eminent. Her comment was... we weren't expecting so many people to come on a Sunday! 
Really?! You weren't expecting people to show up on a SUNDAY?!! Wow! Communication with your costumers is a must. Having worked in the industry that is ideal for a restaurant. We had kids with us and not even water was offered to us. We ended up leaving and went to the BAGEL CAFE, smaller restaurant, also PACKED on Sundays and they accommodated us within 5 min of getting there. 
Will never come to hash house a go go again. You can be an award winner because of your food but your service has left this family not wanting to come back. We will go to the bagel cafe anytime!

Huh?

Well, you are on the strip (the north end by Circus Circus), but there is no Casino here, but there are 2 towers of 27+ stories, a concierge, pool, parking garage, marketplace deli, but no on site restaurants. So maybe this isn't your idea of Vegas. 

But if you come here for business, a family vacation, or to stay more than a 3 day girls' or boys' lost weekend in a drunken stupor, this place has a lot of pluses. 

Like no casino, and no restaurants.

Why is that a plus? 

You get tired of having to plan all your meals around a restaurant or room service. It gets expensive for an extended stay. Plus you don't want to wait in line constantly, get dressed to go out in public, or have to constantly tip valets, servers, cab drivers, etc. 

So you get a 1 bedroom suite here, which includes  full kitchen with toaster, mixer, microwave, oven, stove, full size fridge, pots, pans, plates, glasses, utensils, in unit washer/dryer with complimentary detergent, dining table for 4, dishwasher with complimentary detergent, granite countertops, paper towels, liquid soap and sponge, living room with queen sofa bed, lounge chair and ottoman, dresser, desk/vanity, 2 40 inch LCDTVs (one in each room), King size bed in the bedroom, with amoire and dresser, oversized jacuzzi bathtub, flagstone like bathroom with double entry ways (bedroom, living room), separate glass enclosed shower, large pool area, common pool/ping pong table, activity room, larger than normal gym with machines and free weights, deli/marketplace for casual meals and snack foods, valet or self parking, business center, and VIP lounge. Plus you get Hilton Honors points. 

I got this for $134/night this trip. Bought some groceries for breakfast and lunch, even some for dinner, and chose when to go to a restaurant or a casino, but could always come back and relax. Free WiFi too, and I didn't have to endure any timeshare pitch. 

Actually, I like the set-up quite a bit. 

So I am in Vegas, without always having to be in Vegas.   

When you come here several times  a year, and you have long passed doing the crazy things like in the movies, this is a good choice. 

PS - they really tried to give good service, too. I received 4 different messages about various things, like a welcome packet, free water bottles as a gold Hilton member, when did I want to schedule housekeeping (because I had the do not disturb sign hanging nearly all day), and the concierge letting me know they can book shows and get discounts. 

The small downsides are that parking is not directly attached, it is about 100 yards away; check out is 10 am, and parking costs $8 self or $13 valet. 

I have stayed at the sister Hilton Grand Vacations on nearby Karen Avenue, too, and this one is bigger, nicer, newer, and better service.

This may not be in the exact heart of the strip, but there isn't a steady stream 10 deep of wide eyed-eyed riff raff holding long neck margaritas yelling and screaming outside your window and flashing pics of everything in site. The lot across the street is empty, but they are building another mega hotel next door.

I came in asking for a gel polish change (French/white tip) as I had old polish on before. I'm used to having my old set taken off with at least some technique with acetone -  soak them with cotton/aluminum, soak them in a bowl of acetone, etc. The lady used the drill to take ALL the polish off. OUCH. I figured it was maybe just her method, but I know now to just request maybe drilling the top coat off and soaking the rest like I normally get. Cuticle got hit twice, and nail beds felt like Tabasco had been poured on them. She proceeded to do the French polish to which it was the most horrible job I have ever seen someone paint. I wish I had taken a picture and saved it. Guess I was just too embarrassed at that point. Charged $25, not too happy, left. 

Fast forward to 3 hours later - my left middle finger already had the white tip CHIPPED!!!! WHAT!!!! Gel polish? 5 hours later....4 fingers with cracked polish. Next day, ALL 10. No exaggeration. 

I went back the next day not even 24 hours later to show them and requested to have them removed and to get a refund. They nodded in disbelief that all 10 were cracked (I'd nod in disbelief too). The thing is, I didn't do anything crazy. It would make sense if I was doing something like soaking in a spa, moving boxes, SOMETHING! But it was one of those, I'm going to relax because it's my day off, type of days. I can only imagine what my nails were going to look like if I was actually doing some sort of activity. 

As I request to have my nail polish removed, I requested to NOT HAVE IT DRILLED ALL THE WAY OFF LIKE YESTERDAY. And what does she proceed to do? Yes. You guessed it. Pulled out the drill. Again, top coat, no biggie. But that wasn't the case so I said it once more. What happens? More drill. I finally pointed to the acetone and said PLEASE can we do the acetone? Like a poor puppy. Then she goes on to try to pick it off with her nails. Is acetone that evil for her? 

Toward the end, she said she has to ask her boss for the refund - understandable. Then when she was done, she states that she actually doesn't wanna ask because she might get in trouble. Well, I didn't ask for a horrible nail set along with removing them less than 24 hours later, resulting in burning nail beds and paper thin nail tips. I told her that it was unacceptable in the most calm voice. She was able to give me $20 somehow though! So although I did not get my full refund as expected, I learned not to come back here.

I'm giving it 2 stars only because my 18 hour braised short ribs were pretty decent ... It would have been better had it not been COLD. When they said ""18-hour braised"" I didn't think they meant it would feel like 18 hours had passed before you got your food. 
My entire party's food was cold. We had ordered some drinks and wine, and had to wait at least half an hour for us to get our drinks. Some of them got the wrong drink order and some drinks given to the wrong people. I supposed when it takes you that long to get a drink, you tend to forget whose drink belongs to whom -__-  still, I'm pretty sure it doesn't take that long to get wine. I mean.. 1)open bottle 2) pour 3) serve. 
Service was AWFUL. It didn't seem like the waiters really knew what they were doing. They offered to split our checks, and at the end of the night, said they couldn't. Maybe because they knew they were already going to get gratuity?? (Our party was 6+) who knows. The table next to us were seated after us and they got their good before us.

The phenomenon they are experiencing is called resting on your laurels.  Management is at fault but the gradual dwindling of their business is happening because the staff is rude and gradually people are doing what I'm doing and finding other places to pay $60 for a steak.  Food is still good.  The hearts of palm salad was always a favorite.  The truffle tater tots used to be amazing but the last few times I have eaten there, they just are not the same.  To give you an example of what I mean by the staff is rude...if they were to be told they were rude, without question  they would retort that it is because the patron is a jerk.  They are confrontational and righteous versus polite and helpful and friendly. 

The bartenders in this town all have a difficult job.  There are so many rude, drunk and otherwise unpleasant people that over time I could see a tendency to lump all customers in to that category and treat them accordingly.   I watch people very closely.  These people have much more interest in talking crap on the customers with each other than they do in doing their jobs.  It's the unspoken disregard for the customer experience, the inattentive service, and the overall perspective that coming to work is a social outing for the employee and having to deal with these bothersome customers who want us to pretend like we are glad they are here is an effort.  I will suffer through mediocre service at Denny's, but when I am paying for $16 martinis, I want to be served with a sincere smile.  I could go on. Bottom line is this.

Facility:  not a bad little casino. It was pretty empty for a Sat night. It was about 10:30 or 11:00 and we were one of 3 patrons in the bar/food area. I saw a few stragglers roaming around the casino, but not many.  Not sure how this place stays open. 

Service:  decent...nice enough and checked back on us a few times.

Maybe she was the bartender. Anyway, we got a good laugh out of it. 

Beer:  yum!  They served a nice Amber beer in a liter mug, which hit the spot.  I thought I was back in Germany with a mas of beer!  ""I'm prosting, I'm prosting""!

I must not get it.

I've been wanting to try them for quite some time, and learned they now have a spot open on the Strip (not the touristy part everyone knows, but a little further past Mandalay Bay at the Premium Outlets South). As that is on the way to my gym, I decided to roll out early, stop at Five Guys, and work it off at Fight Capital.

Walking in, you feel good about the place. It's kinda diner-y, simple... tables, chairs, and a team of employees hurriedly working on food in the kitchen. Kinda In-N-Out-esque. REALLY In-N-Out-esque. Like, you wonder if you walked into an In-N-Out instead of Five Guys. There was only one person ahead of me in line, and the cashier, Michelle, was quick and pleasant. I ordered a Bacon Burger, which if you leave it that way, is just that: bread, patty (actually two) and bacon. Anything else on it you have to make sure to specify, so I added my standard toppings -- lettuce, tomato, and BBQ sauce. An onion ring might have been a nice touch, but hey, I don't run the place. Didn't see mustard on the list... hmmmm... well, it's probably by the ketchup, because I didn't see that on the list either. I also ordered some Cajun fries and a drink.

So, let's start with some of the good things here. First off, the employees are very efficient. One person barked orders at the other, everyone had their station, very assembly-line style, and I got my food quickly, which was great because I was famished. Secondly, the Coke machine is, without a doubt, very cool. It's one of those new Coke-brand stations with a touch screen. You touch the soda you want, then you choose regular or with flavored syrup, and POOF -- it's Cokeapalooza! I went with a cherry Coke Zero. Wise choice. On my second visit I noticed there was Diet Barq's (root beer with BITE!), but no cherry option, and I was really diggin' on the cherry Coke Zero, so I went back to that.

The Cajun fries were some of the best I've had in a really long time. Zing-y, spicy, good with or without ketchup. Definitely was loving the fries.

Definitely was NOT loving the burger. Sure, it was a nice surprise that the burgers came standard with two patties, but they were kinda dry and lifeless. Apparently standard setting for their burgers is well-done. Any cook or chef will tell you that overcooking ground beef will cook out the juice and flavor of the meat, and that's what happened here. Bacon was overcooked as well. And by ""overcooked"" I mean ""burnt."" Fortunately I had sauces to back me up, BBQ sauce and.....

Oh yeah. That's another thing. There's no mustard in the entire restaurant. Let me repeat that: THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MUSTARD IN THE ENTIRE HAMBURGER JOINT. No pump, no packets, nothing. I looked on the Coke machine to see if they had it stashed on their touch-screen. I thought about asking, but that would require the only non-assembly-line employee to leave her cash register. Plus, I thought, I shouldn't have to ask for mustard in a friggin' burger joint.

Final blow: Price. I ordered burgers, fries, and a drink, thinking, meh. $8. Should be okay with that. Oh no no, my friend. Everything is a la carte and you will order and take it up the wallet, my friend. By the time I had finished my order I was $11 in and there was no turning back. it felt as if the place was called ""Five Guys"" because you'd be paying the paychecks for five guys. Now, I would expect to pay $11, maybe more, at Holsteins or Burger Bar, where I would also not be looking for a ""quick bite"" and know I would get more (much more) bang for my buck (all eleven of them). This was not $11 quality. Nowhere close. Ironic, as I stared at the sign that said the Washingtonian or some other print media said in 2007 it was the ""best bargain"" around. Apparently in Washington you make a bazillion dollars an hour there. (Hmm... maybe The Gazillionaire is from Washington...)

So yeah. A mediocre burger with overcooked patties and overcooked price points. And no mustard. The employees saved it from being a one-star review though.

I probably won't be back here anytime in the near future; if I am it will be because someone dragged me there. I'll be the guy with only the Cajun fries, playing with the Coke machine.",1/28/2012 9:13,36.137031,-115.208462,2909 S Decatur Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89102,"Music & DVDs, Books, Mags, Music & Video, Shopping, Vinyl Records",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Wax Trax Records

I'm from LA and felt that was too bold a statement to go untested. Granted, I was a tad hungover from the night before and my appetite was a bit wonky but knew my tummy would thank me for some needed sustenance. 

We shared the combo plate and the server gave us all three sauces to try. The chicken was moist and flavorful. And to my surprise, the garlic sauce was PHENOMENAL. Just a small amount packs a punch and, depending on your preference, might even edge out the old LA standby (sorry, Zankou!) because it doesn't linger on your tongue or make you feel like a garlic bomb went off in your mouth or have you fiending after a breath mint after the meal (note: Karved gives you a chocolate mint as part of your meal). The hot sauce also has a kick that I enjoyed. The pitas are high quality and I recommend getting an order of hummus. The pitas come perfectly warm and crispy-soft (crispy on the outside, soft on the inside) without being greasy. 

Food aside, I loved the look and feel of the place. From Karved's mission statement, the hand-written menu on butcher paper, the polished metal ceiling, and even the oh-so-cute bathroom, you can tell that each decorative decision was chosen with care.

The place only had 2 other tables that had customers at them. Right then I expected the worst and that came to be....we ordered 1 dozen large females and 1/2 dozen jumbo females...the jumbos where exactly the same size as the large females when I say large and jumbo I am talking about crab corners sizing which are really small and medium if ordering in Baltimore or other areas of MD....I am ok with that, I know what to expect with crab corners' sizing. But for the Jumbo price I do expect at least extra large crabs. 

The crabs did taste great and were full as in the past visits. We have been getting crabs here since they first opened...The past few times the service has been just shy of horrific ...that night the waiter did not come back after dropping off the crabs to see how things were or to  refill our sodas...my granddaughter refilled ours as needed.

One other thing I need to mention, we ordered one bowl of soup and boardwalk fries for starters .....the soup never came and the fries arrived the same time as the crabs.

I have met the owners when they first opened and they were very attenitive to their business and taking care of the customers. I am only writing this that they may wake up and smell the coffee before their hired help runs them out of business.

It CLEARLY states on their website that the Grand Canyon tours DO NOT include comedy.  The reason being that the tour guides would have to spend more time explaining the jokes than actually telling them so it became a waste and they decided to change it. The tour IS, however, fully narrated and you will learn a lot if you decide that you want to listen. 

Luckily, we ended up getting Jody on our tour and even though the tour did not focus on comedy at all she was still very funny and extremely enjoyable. She was very knowledgeable and kept us on a steady and comfortable schedule throughout every stop. 

The tour itself was the West Grand Canyon tour that we actually found on groupon for $109 including a sit down breakfast and lunch. Pickups start at 6am -6:30am and You have 7 different pickup location options and ours was at the Excalibur hotel rotunda area which is located directly across from the hotel check in lobby NOT IN THE FRONT OF THE HOTEL (just ask inside if you can't find it)  Once picked up you'll head to breakfast if you chose that option for a 30 minute sit down meal at the Omelet house and choose between about 7 different options. Afterwards you'll head through the desert as your tour guide will explain your schedule and watch a detailed video of the skywalk. Then once you get to the canyon you'll jump on a few shuttle buses to each of your 4 lookout points which you'll have a predetermined amount of time to stay at.  In between you will have lunch at either Guano point or the Cowboy Ranch and be able to pick up some souvenirs at any of the gift shops. Once the time is up at the Canyon you'll head back and watch a movie. Also depending on the time frame, you will either stop briefly at the hoover dam before or after your time at the Canyon and then head back to the same pickup locations to be dropped off. 

Our tour was absolutely amazing. The lookout points were breathtaking, the food was great and the ride was smooth thanks to our driver Phil. Capped off by the best tour guide we could ever have asked for, this was an extremely enjoyable experience that I don't think could have gone any better. 

If you have any questions at all, just email them. They were very helpful with every question that I had for them before booking the tour.",5/11/2015 0:33,36.1174528,-115.1766881,"3500 Las Vegas Blvd, Ste E03b",NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Beauty & Spas, Shopping, Cosmetics & Beauty Supply",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Creed Boutique

Everything we've ordered was all hits and the service was almost perfect! Lotus of Siam with their off business hours isn't ideal for you to just drop by and expect to get a table you'll definitely have to make reservations. For us, we made reservations a week in advance and we were only given only a choice for late night dining (probably due to the evening we wanted to eat here). I know when I told Nadine from Hawaii (who was there at the same time) she lucked out and got reservations the next day! so, day to day could vary but, definitely make reservations before you come.

The food:

My goodness, we ordered a family style meal for us to share and got the Soft Shell crab salad, garlic prawns, charbroiled shrimp. deep fried pork belly, duck pad kee mao, prawn tom yum, duck khao soi, and some chicken wings. 

The soft shell crab salad was pretty delicious but a little on the acidic side when it came to the actual salad. The soft shell crab was deep fried perfectly and the amount of crab was generous.

The deep-fried pork belly was crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. The greens were a perfect pair with the pork belly along with the delicious sauce that's tossed with it. This dish is exactly what you can get at most restaurants in LA's Thai town and it's absolutely delicious.

Garlic prawns were perfect in flavor! the shrimp were deep fried perfectly and tossed with roasted garlic that enhanced the flavor. To add a bed of salad added amazing texture to the dish.

Prawn Tom Yum, the best Tom Yum I've ever had in a restaurant! the flavors were just out of the world and taste nothing like your generic Thai restaurants back home. The traditional serving bowl is all so familiar but, instead of the broth being overly sour or sweet (some places add pineapples), this dish is the perfect balance of hot and sour while, not overpowering where you can't taste the actual flavors of the prawns and vegetables. The best part, there's no weird American cut wavy carrots in this dish.

Our favorite dish was the Charbroiled Prawns AND you have to get the Fresh chili, lime, and garlic sauce. If you have any Mien friends you'll thank me because this asian salsa tastes just like Mien sauce and boy, it's smackin'. The Prawns are again, perfectly charbroiled, not rubbery but, melts in your mouth. The salsa adds some acidity, spice, and amazing flavor while the salad adds texture to the dish. MUST GET DISH!

The star of the show, the Duck Khao Soi was just amazing. If you enjoy eating the Lao dish, Khao Poon (or kapoon) you'll fall in love with this Thai version of Khao Soi (or kasoy)! The spicy coconut curry flavor of the broth is perfect in flavor and the perfect consistency without being too thick but thick enough to coat and stick to all the ingredients but light enough for it to be a good noodle soup broth (just like khao poon). The choice of noodle is thick egg noodle and it's perfect for this dish.

Let me pause and praise the duck that Lotus of Siam use. I'm not a huge fan of Duck and what made me enjoy duck was LA's Sun Ha Jang Mary's Farm duck. Then I came here to Lotus of Siam, and it just blew my mind of how amazing duck can taste! Sun Ha Jang opened my world of good tasting Duck but Lotus of Siam made me a Duck lover.

*All the spice level was 4/5 for all dishes. Next time we visit we might have to go for full on hot just to make us sweat a bit more

I know that doesn't exactly qualify me for knowing about outdoor ranges, but I promise there's good reason for the 3 stars. 

I've been 3 times now. First time, the pistol and rifle range was closed for a private event, so we went to the shotgun range. We went into the office, paid for everything, went outside. There was no real indication of what to do once we got to the numbered area that we were assigned. So we stood there and kind of snooped around, only to have someone who was not at all identified as staff yell at us for touching something on the supervisor chair (at which there was nobody at). Then we were told after paying for everything that the shotgun we had wasn't recommended  at the shotgun range. 

The second 2 times, we were able to go to the pistol range, which was a much more pleasant experience. The most recent time, the gentleman at the check in area after paying was a bit condescending. I get that they're trying to maintain safety and make sure everyone has paid, but I guess I just expect a certain level of professionalism rather than loudly humiliating customers. It was just an unpleasant experience having to deal with him. 

I recommend bringing your own guns and ammo. Ammo isn't really cheap and both times I've been to the pistol and rifle range, their rentals were on a waitlist. 

All that being said, the drive once you enter the complex is quite pretty and has beautiful views. They take safety extremely seriously. They have a pretty good variety of targets available for cheap. They have classes on safety sometimes. 

It's the closest place to me to go shoot, so I'll be back. But try to do as much reading up on their rules and stuff before you get there so as to avoid any public humiliation.",3/21/2017 5:36,36.110792,-115.171413,"3663 Las Vegas Blvd S, Ste 385",NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Fashion, Shopping, Women's Clothing, Accessories",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,ANGL

rw4_suXMsmzjgyG4_TEqaA,QzXS25_FwIUrYTyDMZkUQA,YIYE7Zk61McLaekLFluzTg,5,4,1,2,"I look forward to the last Sunday of every month because Chaiya has a special place in my heart. And by heart, I mean stomach.

This is basically a small little food fair held in the parking lot of the monastery where all the funds raised goes towards the monastery itself. FYI, the lovely vendors here donate their time, money, and resources! They keep absolutely none of the profit.

The food selection is not that vast, but what they do have is always ace. In addition to food, they have home-grown herbs and vegetables, desserts, and Thai snacks.

Here's a rundown of the items I typically get:
- Moo Ping/Pork Skewers: 4 for $5, grilled, juicy, and sweet, get it with the sticky rice ($1)!
- Pad Thai: $5, probably the most popular item, generous portion, cooked to order so may take some time, there is a sign-up sheet
- Clear Pork Noodle Soup: $5, light, choice of thin or thick noodles, condiments on the side
- Thai Tea or Thai Coffee: $1, too sweet for me
- Ba Tan Ko/Chinese Donuts: 50 cents a piece, dip in condensed milk, childhood favorite :)
- Roti: $1, filled with condensed milk and cooked with sugar until crispy
- Saku Sai Moo: 3 for $1, tapioca dumplings filled with pork, soft and tender, ask for veggies and fresh chili!
- The rice noodle dumpling next to the tapioca dumplings: 3 for $1, super soft, kind of oily

Other notable items are sticky rice with pork, sticky rice with mango, coconut milk dessert, and naam (fermented pork sausage).

My main gripe is that seating can be difficult to find because word has gotten out about this little gem. This year is the busiest I have ever seen! Great for business, but not so much for those looking to eat on the premises. However, you can always share a table with some friendly folks.

Everything is affordable and delicious and the proceeds go towards a great cause. Chaiya is one of the few places in Vegas that feels like there's an actual community rather than a gathering of strangers.",8/31/2015 22:01,36.158873,-115.1381442,1100 E Charleston Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89104,"Thrift Stores, Donation Center, Local Services, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Savers

nf_MSg1nsJgC_6P8laua2Q,4jjMPfo3vmVm5LY8ZJhd6g,j7YBahlSm7jjAdd_oWYIBg,4,9,1,3,"Lemme tell you, this is so much nicer than the old Monte Carlo.

Let's get a few things out of the way:
1. The hotel is still being renovated, but it seems like it's drawing completion and should be done by the end of the year.
2. That being said, there was SOME construction noise coming from above (we were on the 28th floor) and I think that is due to them finishing the Nomad Hotel on floors 29 - 32. 
3. Also due to the renovations, the resort isn't immediately accessible from the strip. You have to go out side entrances, but it looks like once they open Eataly (from my understanding, the modern day version of a food court) it'll be accessible from the strip.
4. Food options, especially at night, are a little lacking. I'm sure this will be fixed once the renovations are complete. 

Okay, those out of the way let's get into the good and bad (ignoring the fact that it's being renovated).

PROS:
- Room is gorgeous. It's small, but it's functional. And it's got this European-vintage vibe (almost feels like a Wes Anderson film?). 
- Bathroom is fantastic. Huge shower, nice sized sink, good lighting. This isn't a huge bathroom you'd get in suites of other hotels (remember, everything here is a little smaller) but it's very well done. If you've stayed at the SLS before, it's a similar size. 
- The location is perfect. Park MGM is connected to Aria via a hallway and has a tram on site, taking you to both Aria, Vdara, and Bellagio. 
- The whole hotel has just a gorgeous look to it. It's different from the rest of the strip. It feels a little old, but in a good way. Things have a mid-century modern feel to them. It's not loud in any way, it's a very elegant design.
- The food options seem to be pretty good. I didn't eat at Moneyline or Bavettes, but Primrose was phenomenal. Decent prices too. We ate in the smaller dining room, but the main dining room and patio seemed to be really cute -- I'd definitely come back again.
- The bed is the most comfortable bed I've had in quite some time. I began craving the bed at the end of the night.
- Checkin was smooooooth. Got an email the morning of asking my preferences and what time I was planning on checking in. 15 minutes before the time I selected (6PM) I got an email with a QR code. Went to the self checkin desk, scanned a code, and out popped the key cards. I sorta miss interacting with a checkin agent, but this made checkin a breeze. Super impressed.
- Did I mention how good Primrose was?
- Honestly, it seems like you can get a decent view no matter what side of the hotel you are on -- NYNY / Excalibur / Mandalay Bay or City Center / North Strip or MGM Grand / Planet Hollywood. Wish the windows were bigger, but it's an older hotel so you won't really find that.

CONS:
- Prices can vary. I wouldn't spend more than $125 - 150 a night here as there are plenty of better options (Vdara). 
- Lack of storage in the room. Other than a small two drawer nightstand (think Ikea Malm sized) in the closet, there is no other storage. According to a maintenance person, this is being fixed in the near future -- the hotel is planning on adding dressers to every room.
- Lack of fridge / microwave / coffee maker. This isn't a hug deal for me, but there were a few times where I wished we had a mini fridge. Doesn't have to be huge, but I wish we had the option. Go across the street to the ABC store and get yourself a cooler to keep things cold.
- Resort Fee / Parking fee. C'mon MGM, just give us the price of the room up front. This goes for practically any strip hotel -- stop trying to advertise a low price only to add an additional 30% (per night) in fees. If this keeps up, I'll probably stop going to Vegas honestly. 
- This isn't really a con, but part of me wishes they had a vase with a flower or something in it. The table by the sofa / window seat was empty. Would have been nice to carry the nature theme and have some sort of plant in the room. 

To sum things up, if you can get this hotel for under $100 a night, it's totally worth it. $100 - 125ish, I would say it's sorta worth it, but also worth exploring other options. $150+ I would say it's not worth it (unless all hotels are expensive that day) -- it's still an older, smaller hotel. You can get more some at Aria / Vdara / Cosmo for that price.

In my opinion, nicer than Mandalay, Luxor, Trop, Excalibur, MGM Grand, NYNY, Planet Hollywood, LINQ, TI, Mirage, etc etc. Only hotels that are better are the obvious 5 star hotels (Bellagio, Cosmo, Aria, Vdara, Palazzo, Wynn, etc).",9/25/2018 2:56,36.1585659,-115.0806089,4275 E Charleston Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89104,"Sporting Goods, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Big 5 Sporting Goods

As always a great time and enjoyed the night.

The Con's:

* The bathrooms kill me. Have to walk up stairs to the second floor. Not easy when you have had a few.

* Again, we got there early and decided to wait at the bar and enjoy the night. Only issue is they let all the bar seats go to diners at the bar, Thus no one waiting and enjoying the evening can sit for a glass of wine. 

The Pro's:

* Great hostess staff, very nice gals.

* Waiter and staff are great, Robert made sure we had everything we needed and check in at the right times. They have a very well trained staff, and support waiters, they always seem to be right there when you need something.

* Food is always top notch.  By far the best consistently good quality we have ever had at a steak house. (and we have been to them all). The are always right now with any special requests and its perfect.

* Wife really enjoyed the baked halibut special.

* They created our desert per my wife's request and it was perfect.

The reason I'm giving her such a low rating is because her customer service is horrible. I booked an appointment with her two weeks-three weeks prior to her raising her prices so I booked at a $90 full set and then the night before my appointment she texted me saying she more than doubled her prices to $200. I asked her if I could get the original price I booked for since I booked it two weeks ago and she told me about the price change less than 24 hours before my appointment and she said no. To me, that's really shady. You can't give someone less than a 24 hour notice of doubling prices. She should've applied the price change to newly booked appointments not to people who booked at the price of $90. I would've been more than happy to pay the new prices in the future if I would've had sufficient notice. She should've honored the old price to the people that booked at that price. Good customer service is so important to a small business so she really needs to work on that. But with all that being said, overall her services are great just really needs to work on customer service. I probably will not be going back to her since majority of lash shops charge way less than that.",9/23/2017 1:05,36.062574,-115.0485625,1445 W Sunset Rd,NV,Henderson,89014,"Art Supplies, Shopping, Arts & Crafts",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Aaron Brothers Art & Framing

One thing that irritated me was that they have a little clock at the bottom of the staircase indicating how long you will have to wait in line for the elevator to the top.  It is a blatant lie.  It said that it would be between 10-15 minutes before we arrived at the top.  We waited over a half hour before we could even SEE the elevator.  -_-   It gets worse.  There is a wait for another half hour at the top of the tower just to get to the elevator to come back down.

The pad Thai was good, but it was a serious 7 and almost too hot for my taste buds so somewhat hard to eat. 
The mixed veggies & brown sauce was delicious and something I'd definitely order again.

We have eaten at Gordon Ramsay's Pub on previous occasions and while not outstanding, we have never had the abysmal service that we experienced on Thursday 3/26. I booked a month in advance for a party of 6, expecting a dining table or booth. Instead we were shown to a high top bar table with stools in a crowded, extremely (shouting to each other to talk) bar. Nothing else available we were told. Server took ten minutes to acknowledge us. Drinks were offered. Another ten minutes passed before we were able to order. While the appetizer of mildly hot and sweet wings was good, the rest of the meal went downhill. Two diners ordered Shepard's Pie, mediocre reviews. Lobster Mac & Cheese first course was over price at approx $22 ($24?) dollars and missing lobster. Two diners ordered the organic chicken dish. When dinner was served, after an almost 40 minute wait, the Organic chicken turned out to be Bangers and Mash. When this was called to our servers attention, he said (and I quote), ""Oh, the button for the Organic Chicken is beside the Bangers and Mash, I must have pushed the wrong button."" When we advised just to take the plates and we didn't want to wait another 40 minutes for our entree he offered to bring us a Shepards Pie (which they must have made ahead and keep ready under warmers?) Since neither of us eat red meat this was not an option. Our table asked for salt and pepper four times before it was brought, after dinner was essentially over. Our consolation for no dinner? Our server grudgingly offered dessert ""on him"". Incidentally, while no one could remember to bring condiments, they did manage to return to the table four times to refill drink orders from the bar, thus goosing up the check to the best of their ability. Terrible, terrible service and Chef should be appalled. No manager approached or offered apologies. I left a 10% tip, my husband, who is usually overgenerous with tips, wanted to leave nothing.

Though they don't advertise the vegan menu out front, but if you ask, they'll show you their vegan menu. The list is pretty extensive. I want to try the tofu parmesan sub, but my dinner mate wanted pizza to share.

We went there after a little past 8pm on a Friday night, we were prepared to wait forever but surprisingly there wasn't any line for dine in, but the drive thru was very busy. 

For a fast food chain, they have a very fresh quality food. I ordered the Spicy Deluxe and it was really good. The waffle fries was a little undercook for me so next time I'll order them well done/extra crispy. The service was very fast and the staff are super friendly. The fine in area is also clean. Just FYI, the drinks are behind the counters next to the register, but you do get refills for as many as you want.  And the staff are very good with checking on you if you need any refills or extra sauce. My favorite dipping sauce is their Garlic Ranch.

Women wear dresses that push up that milk shelf. And there was a time I used to spike my hair up with gel and wear one of my silk, shiny club shirts. Where is that fire from 8 years ago?

Many stories I heard of before the club when the area was the Lion's head entrance and Wizard of Oz Tribute was the previous incarnation of MGM. Each wing of the hotel used to have it's own color and theme. 

At Grand adventures out back I experienced, where I met the street performers, one of which is still very much Wayne Brady. And I spent many times in a quiet wing of the hotel that I also used as a shortcut and a largely unknown public bathroom. I later found that it used to actually be the Marina I saw in many vintage pictures and postcards. 

For a club on the strip, I'm amazed when I look back at how many nights I spent trying to work on my game here. Little did I know other landmark things in my life would happen here. 

Studio 54 is great simply because it's a club on the strip that retains it's original name and design for over 5 years, something other night clubs can't seem to do. And in it's preservation lies many memories of one of the first hangouts I can write about on yelp (since the Beach Club and Woody's, even Red Room are closed). I never understood though, why don't they ever have a disco night??

There are nice different little areas of the club and I have to admit, they had a VIP area before Light opened and ruined the club scene for me. But this was fun for me and my 2 closest club buds of mine at the time, Josh and Scotty.  

Every time we went, we were somehow able to scheme our way into their VIP. We were servers, but to score those cookies and finger sandwiches became the goal of the night for me rather than a phone number on a napkin. Satisfying my hunger seemed more obtainable than rounding 3rd. I got girls to talk to me when I intentionally left VIP with my hand up armed with cookies sticking out of a bev nap.

Josh was a pretty boy whose sexuality Scott and I always questioned because he was somehow bored with women's leering to our dismay. They looked at him the way I looked at the Steak buffet at Sam's Town. I never got that look from a woman on first contact. Maybe I hung out with them so I could at least experience the shrapnel from such an explosion in what we referred to as ""fity fo."" 

Years later, I was kinda talked into going to a Halloween party by 2 girls I kinda knew and one I didn't. One was a roller derby girl I knew from matches and the other someone I met years ago at the Fantasy and Fetish Ball, the year it was held at the Stardust right before they tore it down. I have the most stories from that single event than I do from the 3 ""tamest"" First Friday drinking stories I have. 

The burlesque dancer I kinda knew, something sparked that night which led to many adventures after and also gained me a girlfriend and roommate. I had many train wreck handshake roommates, but this was the second time that my name was officially on a rental lease. It was the second best place I lived in Vegas, the other- on my own- was known as The Pointe (now Bella Vita) and actually had an identical floor plan to boot. It was cool to get an identical place years later, I knew where everything goes!

So fity fo is a place I could associate with my favorite holiday and anniversary.

Back when, me and the guys used to spend time after in what used to be the center stage lounge before it became a bevtainer bar and sportsbook. We'd see girls stagger out as we assessed the night and wondered what we were going to do next, often Drai's that went on past 7:00AM. Not only did I spend nights out til sunrise, but 80 degree LATE morning sunlight and rising. 

God, was I ever that young? 

It was a time when I had control over a good corner of my life. I have spent a majority of my time thinking how I could get that back with no budget or resources.

It's a vicious circle, I can't get the spark without a paycheck, nor a paycheck until the impression I give in an interview overpowers the dark mysteries of a brick wall the reference checks hold.

I am close to getting my stride back. On a different dance floor, in a dance instruction club.",9/4/2011 21:37,36.24297836,-115.2350491,"4570 N Rancho Dr, Ste 1, Bldg C",NV,Las Vegas,89130,"Fashion, Shoe Stores, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Red Wing Shoes

Last year we saw Beauty and the beast, and it was really good , the stage and sound quality is far above expectations. It was a well directed and organized production, just as good as some Broadway shows I have seen in the past. 

This year we went to the wedding singer, and the production was great, same quality show and overall organization. 

So now I have seen multiple shows and they both are great presentations. The quality of show really makes you feel like you in a high production show not sitting in a park eating a picnic.

So the seating is first come first serve, I recommend getting there aroud 6 to 630. Bring a blanket and a picnic have some drinks. They normally have a good section of vendors selling fair stlye food for reasonable price. I do recommend renting one of the chairs that sit on the ground they are $1. 

The downside and the only downside if you ask me, the restroom situation is not nice ( as a guy I'm ok but the last 2 times my wife has had no tp and had to hover ( or that's what she calls it )

Maybe because there have been such low ratings for this location before, we did notice that this location wasn't as crazy busy as others along The Strip.  Most mornings were quiet and relaxing here.

Another reason for coming to this Starbucks location is the view!  During our visits, we were able to snag a high top table by the windows overlooking Bellagio's Lake Como as the sunlight softly streamed in.

I don't really write reviews unless I feel specifically amazed or disgusted by something...This review is because I was so incredibly amazed by Ryan and Bliss Entertainment Event Group! I just got married 19 days ago at Escondido Center for the Arts Museum in California, and I still can't stop thinking about how amazing our reception was. Bliss Entertainment set the ambiance for the venue with the lighting, the music, the photobooth and everything in between! The DJ was amazing and knew exactly what music to play and when to play it to keep the dance floor full.  Not only did they meet our expectations, they went above and beyond! My first dance with my wife was phenomenal; we started to dance and out of no where clouds appeared beneath our feet and impressed not only us, but everyone in the room. Every detail was taken care of without any problem. The lighting of the walls and centerpieces made every photo taken by guests beautiful. Everything was done in a timely fashion and Ryan was always easy to communicate with throughout the whole process before and after my wedding. Got copies of photobooth pictures at the end of the night and laughed our heads off at people's pictures! I would give more stars if I could on this review but I am only limited to 5!

While this park offers several things the baseball and softball fields probably yield the most attention. They have 5 of them and they are well kept. From the O'Bannon Dr. side you will find 4 of the 5 fields and plenty of parking from that entrance. From the W. Oakey Blvd entrance is the other field and picnic area that you can reserve. The picnic area is first come first serve if not reserved. Even though my friends reserved the spot months in advance and the paperwork was posted showing it was reserved, people had already posted up in the spot when they arrived and had to be told politely that the spot was already taken. The picnic area is nice and spacious. Lots of tables under plenty of shade and plenty of surrounding tables out of the shade. My friends also hired a taco man and they had plenty of space to set up. There is a running faucet and counter area. The faucet/sink needs work because the faucet was bent and the bottom of the sink was black. Cans are set up for trash and recycle and working outlets meant we were able to play music which was nice. They have a small playground area with slides and swings as well a water play area that the kids at the party had a great time cooling off at. There are plenty of big trees where the large imported pinatas that were brought to the party hung and the kids had a blast. 

When it comes to the fee for reserving the picnic area (there is only 1 picnic area) I can't believe how affordable it is. For just $25 the picnic area is yours from 8 am - 10 pm. My nephews first birthday was at a park in Henderson and the fee was much, much more and the picnic area was smaller with less options. For parties larger than 50 you need to call and find out about possibly getting a permit. You will also need a special event permit if you plan on serving alcohol at your party. When making your reservation make sure and let them know if you plan on having a DJ or bounce house.",5/22/2014 15:47,36.128561,-115.1711298,,NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Sporting Goods, Customized Merchandise, Arts & Entertainment, Art Galleries, Shopping, Hobby Shops, Auction Houses",,,,,Shopping,,Entertainment,ShoppingEntertainment,Inscriptagraphs Sports & Entertainment Memorabilia

H2P2iDl8ShOotd4qBpwtAg,nVI0Q5IA8RAvP5YCfPR4oA,DfgZlNgKwBvCpA_0alumXw,2,1,1,0,"So I went to Vegas for the second time this year, I know I'm addicted. I did the hotel hopping thing. I stayed at 4 Queens the first night, Mandalay Bay the second, The MGM Grand intermittently, and at the Mirage Last. I must say that I am not impressed with this hotel AT ALL. I have so many things to yelp about that I am going to make a list. For EACH PART OF THE ROOM.

BATHROOM:
*Toilet would take two flushes to flush everything down. Gross!
*Bathroom fans did not defog mirrors after showering or get rid of unpleasant smells. What is the point in a fan then?
*Shower head was weak. It took me 3 washes to get all my conditioner out of my hair.
*The toilet lid kept slamming everytime my boyfriend tried to pee. Need I say more?

BED:
*The bedcover looked like it was made out of a 70's couch.
*The bedsheets were itchy and smelled like baby butt. (You know like that cloth diaper service?)
*I got tons of little red bumps on my skin from the sheets. Bed Bugs? I don't wanna know. All I know is that I felt super self conscious about my skin at the pool after that. 

NOISE:
*Doors on this floor slam, hardcore, even if you just let it swing shut. Get some hydraulic springs for the damn doors!
*When other people's doors near ours slam, it rattled our door. Loudly. At all hours of the night and morning. 
*Their little renovation project woke us up early every morning, and kept us up. Do you know how awful it is when someone is hammering in the room above you when you just went to bed four hours earlier and you have a  raging hangover? Not cool AT ALL.
*Someone's alarm in the bedroom next to us went off at the same hour every morning. I don't think anyone was staying there, but it would not shut off! It went off for like an hour, no exaggeration. 

I need to get one of those renovated rooms you yelpers talk about IF I decide to stay there ever again.

So what did I like about the room? Well, the only thing I liked about the room was the fact that it had marble floors in the entryway and a little vanity table and chair to get ready in. 

The room was not the only thing that bothered me, either. I understand why that the pathway from the parking garage goes through the casino before you can get to your room, but must it go through the lobby, the casino, the atrium, another casino, to the elevators and then to the room? By the time I had hauled my luggage (which is not light at all) through all the casino, the crowds of annoying people trying to take pictures where everyone else HAS to walk, and all those other places previously mentioned, I was pissed.

Oh and the pool is not that great as cool as it looks. You rarely get a lounge chair in the sun, and people hog the few there are. Its a small pool, with only one jacuzzi. And the water is cold. I got a great lounge chair next to the walkway where everyone could see my little mirage rash if they wanted. How irritating.

 Oh and the worst part? I paid more per night for this hotel than I did to stay at Mandalay Bay. Ouch.

And yeah the Volcano doesn't work. Sweet. One star for the vanity table and one star for the aquarium behind the Check-In counter.",3/28/2008 4:41,36.082981,-115.148244,5757 Wayne Newton Blvd,NV,Las Vegas,89119,"Shopping, Department Stores, Electronics, Flowers & Gifts, Home & Garden, Fashion, Gift Shops",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Brookstone

I love food trucks and I appreciate the kind of hipster culture they've spawned but is it just me or does it seem like every food truck gets inherently higher grades on Yelp than they would if it was a brick and mortar operation?  Don't get me wrong, there are some really great food trucks out there that are doing innovative cuisine.  Slidin Thru  however, is simply cooking small burgers with some interesting toppings.  Everything tasted fine and I would have no problem going back, Im just not about to soil myself because I just had a hamburger off a truck.

Like I said, the food was decent.  I had a the 3 slider combo for 7 bucks and opted for their Pulled Pork, the burger with the balsamic reduction and the one with feta cheese and bacon.  The buns are soft but rather un-noteworthy.  The beef was cooked nicely but it lacked a distinct flavor.  The Pulled Pork was actually the best of the bunch with a nice, subtle sauce and the right level of moistness in the meat.  The french fries were beyond average but they also offer sweet potato fries for a buck more....might be worth the upgrade.  

The guys running the truck are outgoing and helpful although they do one thing that I think is very unbecoming.  If you pay by credit card, the order taker says ""My machine is asking if you would like to leave a tip.""  I understand his machine may be asking that, but maybe post a sign that say you can leave a tip when paying by debit or credit rather than put people on the spot.   Jeez, thanks for putting me in a pickle.  I mean are you going to tell the guy no straight to his face?  I just think thats a tad audacious.  

My visit corresponded with their new semi-residency at lunch time on Thursdays at UNLV.

I am not going to throw my stylist under the bus since she was a sweetheart, but I was in  tears when I walked out. The color was done in a strange way, my scalp got dyed  a deep red when I went in for blond highlights/lowlights.

Aram along with Hi-Tech's auto team were able to fix my car completely, replace the front bumper with a fresh white paint job to match the car color too. They also completely fixed my headlight issue, and the reason it was out for so long was due to a wiring issue Aram was able to locate with ease. 

The craziest part about their hard work was they were able to do it in such quick, efficient time.

The salsa was a little hot for my taste and I'm not sure the chips were homemade, but they also serve an awesome bean dip with this chips and salsa, so I was pleased. They also give you a bowl of some noodle soup which was pretty decent.

I started out with a Timo's Cadillac margarita, on the rocks, of course. It was excellent! Very nice amount of alcohol and any margarita with Grand Marnier and Triple Sec is going to be awesome. 

I had the three-enchilada combo and got one of each chicken, cheese, and beef. Muy Delicioso, and I don't normally go for enchiladas. They were SMOTHERED in cheese, so not exactly healthy, but what Mexican food is healthy? Another cool thing is they serve breakfast all day. A friend of mine ordered Huevos Mexicanos at 8pm and was very pleased. 

It was Saturday night, so they had a live band; three Hispanic guys walked around the restaurant with three guitars singing some songs in Spanish. They were excellent!

This location was a little over a mile away from our hotel, so we were here in a flash and walked in just before noon for some breakfast.

Parking in the huge lot that they share with Firestone was a snap, and we were immediately seated at a booth in their air conditioned environment.

The menu was bigger than I expected - with tempting pictures.  It's been decades since I've even uttered the word IHOP in a serious way, so my tummy sat up and took notice.

I passed up the T-Bone Steak & Eggs and the Sirloin Tips & Eggs and eyed the omelettes.  The regular omelettes' egg batter has pancake mix in it, to ""make them more fluffy"", so I chose to get the healthy and fit omelette (not served with pancakes like the regular omelettes, but served with fruit instead).  It's made with egg substitute:

Spinach, Mushroom and Onion Omelette, add steak, no salt - served with a mix of cantaloupe, honeydew and grapes, this omelette had fresh leaf spinach, big mushroom slices, and diced onions and tomatoes.  It was fresh, tasty, and the added steak was pretty good. 

Bf had the Sampler - bacon, sausage, eggs,  hash browns and his beloved pancakes, which were indeed fluffy and yummy.

Bf's OJ wasn't fresh squeezed, but the service was very attenttive and the food was so frrsh that I won't fault them too much for the juice.

I guess I can support bf's love for the fluffy going forward!",9/24/2011 21:11,36.173472,-115.11794,"2320 E Bonanza Rd, Ste B",NV,Las Vegas,89101,"Women's Clothing, Fashion, Men's Clothing, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Moda Latina

The pictures from Yelp and Instagram had me drooling in anticipation to try this place for months! I really wanted to try the crispy sisig and coconut halo halo. There was a big group of us and this is what we had: ratings 1-5, (low-high)

Appetizers: 
salt and pepper calamari- 5, yummy! 
Lumpianitas- 2, tastes just like frozen ones you can buy at the store (2orders)
Longganisa on a stick: 3
Garlic fries: 4

Entrees: 
Crispy lechon kawali: 5, mango salsa yummy!
Crispy pork sisig: 5, yummy! (2orders)
Kobe/longganisa burger: ordered but didn't have it available 
Lechon roll: ordered but not available
Pancit: 2 
Chicken adobo: 2
Pork Sisig tacos: 5, daughter loved them! 
Garlic rice: 5
White rice: 5 

Bunch of beers: 4

Dessert:
Ube Souffl√©: 2, ehhhh wouldn't order it again, especially at $8- we ordered 2 

Coconut Halo Halo: 1, my BIGGEST disappointment!!!!! It looks so cute in the pictures but when we had it....it was warm, slightly cold, a little bit of beans, coconut jelly and ??? Where was the shaved ice? Not very good at all. These are $10 and we ordered 2 and couldn't even finish it between the 8 of us. When I think of halo halo, I think of shaved ice, condensed milk, gelatin, coconut jelly, flan, ice cream, and nice and COLD! How sad that Jolibees halo halo is way better and tastes more expensive than what was served to us. 

Now, you may ask...""you have a lot of 5's"" but why the 1 star? 

The service was ok, one waitress stood out because she smiled a lot and was really nice. She was the only one that smiled at us out of that whole staff...even the person who seemed to be the owner didn't even seem to acknowledge anyone or say thank you,seemed snobby. The happy people you see dancing and smiling in their Facebook videos were the complete opposite in person. Not smiling, complacent and seemed annoyed and couldn't wait for us to leave...the waiters seemed very new or inexperienced...more than one person spilled drinks on us and dropped longganisa skewers on to the table off the plate... we still ate it though  I know, gross! Despite all that we still would have tipped them at least 15% but gratuity is already included. 

The one thing I can't stand is people that just don't care. Care about people, care about quality. They either served us halo halo with melted shaved ice or halo halo that's just not very good. Whatever it is, don't fall for the cute photos! I really wanted to love this place, but I'm just really disappointed.",7/5/2017 7:49,36.1003169,-115.1978,4325 W Tropicana Ave,NV,Las Vegas,89103,"Furniture Stores, Home & Garden, Office Equipment, Shopping",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Office Furniture Concepts
FeDrqpDivBEPRzK8iqvlpw,sPbKpor4w91rp5Dw2EhIbw,vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA,4,10,6,7,"I was looking for a good dim sum joint in Vegas. When I travel, I like to try the dim sum from other places. This place did not disappoint. It's located at The Gold Coast Hotel, all the way in the back. I have to give this place props for the nostalgic Chinese feel to it. Everything from the  tables to the uniforms scream Chinese. It seems so out of place at this hotel. It's as if it's in it's own little bubble.

We got there about 10:30am and there was no wait. The place opens at 10:00am. When we left an hour later, the place was packed. When we first got there, I heard the workers speaking in Cantonese, a good sign. The hostess sat us at a table and gave us one of those stamp cards. Every time we took something from the cart that they pushed by us, they would stamp the card. That's how they total the bill at the end. This is the only dim sum place that I've been to that charged for tea. With that being said, the dim sum here is a good deal compared to Hawaii, where I'm from. All the items were about a dollar cheaper. 

We had the black bean spare ribs, chicken feet, shrimp dumplings, stuffed eggplant, and the hot tofu dessert. These are pretty much my staples. I tend to order the same items at dim sum. I have to say the food is excellent. Everything that we ordered was on point. The shrimp in the dumplings was fresh and the wrapper translucent. The chicken feet was plump and huge. The eggplant was stuffed with shrimp paste. My favorite was the hot tofu dessert. It was silky smooth and so yummy with the ginger syrup. It was as good or better than most dim sum places in Hawaii.

As with most dim sum places, you get better service if you speak Cantonese. After the hostess sat us, no carts came around for a while. As soon as I asked for shrimp dumplings in Cantonese, the hostess waved all the carts over. Within 10 seconds, I had all four carts in front of me. My husband was laughing because he knew the drill. This happens at a majority of dim sum places that we go to.",11/5/2015 11:26,36.111272,-115.190517,"4325 S Valley View Blvd, Ste B",NV,Las Vegas,89103,"Kitchen & Bath, Shopping, Building Supplies, Home Services, Countertop Installation, Flooring, Home & Garden, Contractors",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,National Stone

Another time they told me that I needed my spider replaced which is in the fuel system and that would have been 2800 dollars I took it to another shop and it cost me 1200 dollars.

Do not be afraid of the ginormous line outside of the club as the line will move quickly and you'll be in the club in no time.  

It is beautiful inside.  If you can actually focus on the decor for a minute and ignore the sudden urge to dance and drink, then you can appreciate how intricate and pretty it really is inside.  There is an obvious trendy Asian theme going on, with huge butterfly-like fans littered cross the ceiling.  Super trippy.  The booths are really nice and large if you're into the bottle service gig.  The restrooms are awesome and huge, complete with tons of bathroom stalls and mirrors to check up on your makeup or check how your butt looks in that skank-ho dress--I know I did!  Be sure to check out the patio and the pool since I've heard raving reviews about it.  I, however, was too inebriated to saunter outside and squeeze through a dance floor of hot, gyrating people.  

The music is great.  The DJ really knows how to get the crowd pumped up and won't switch to new songs every fifteen seconds. The dance floor is large, if my memory serves me correctly, but it fills up quickly after midnight.  Don't fret, there is bound to be a space for you to get your groove on the dance floor. 

The bars are super packed with people barking out orders so it  can be a daunting task trying to purchase your libations (This is when bottle service comes in handy.  Unfortunately, not all of us are baller like that.  Sad face. Sigh!).

The crowd is sexy,  beautiful people everywhere and only here!

This restaurant is located in MGM and we valet because we were running a few minutes late. They do charge for both valet and self parking. We ended up paying $15 for the first 4 hrs. 

Though we were a few minutes late it was like 5 minutes or so before we got seated. The ambiance in the restaurant is nice with low lighting. 

My group ordered the:

Ribeye
Hanger steak
Lobster salad 
Filet mignon 
Grilled corn side

All meat dishes were cooked medium rare

The ribeye and hanger steak were beautifully cooked. Delicious flavor to it and a good balance of meat and fat. I would definitely recommend these two. 

The lobster salad was lobster served in the shell of half a lobster on a bed of ice with a pile of seaweed. Which wasn't what I expected. I was hoping it was an actual salad. Especially since what I originally was trying to order was a lobster bisque underneath the salad section but it was in fact a soup (don't get why it was there, but the idea would have sounded delicious if it was a salad) and the server suggested the lobster salad instead. TBH not hat impressed with it for the price. 

The filet mignon was good but pale in comparison to the other two meat dishes. It was tender but plain. Unless that's how filet mignon is normally served I kind of wish it was a bit seasoned-even with salt and pepper *shrug

I saved the best for last. As other posts may have mentioned their grilled corn side (don't remember he actual name but it is the only corn side) was BOMB. It has onions in it and cilantro(if I remember correctly) and I must say I can order that and just eat it on its own. Would highly highly recommend this side.",9/6/2017 21:44,36.128561,-115.1711298,,NV,Las Vegas,89109,"Cosmetics & Beauty Supply, Spray Tanning, Beauty & Spas, Shopping, Skin Care, Tanning",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,BOLD Body Bronzing

I made reservations with this company because I heard about it on Groupon. When I looked at the website, the Sunset Tour caught my eye so I called to book it. No one answered so I left a voicemail. I called in the early afternoon but no one returned my call until 10:00 am the following morning. I tried to book the Sunset Tour but all the lady said was ""we can't"" no legit reason but she offered us a tour at 2:00pm which was no big deal so I agreed. 

On the day of our scheduled tour (which was about a week after I booked the reservation) I received a text message that read exactly like this ""Need TO cancel horse ride guide is sick"" I received this text at 11:58am when my tour was scheduled for 2:00pm. Not only was it unprofessional for this business to send a text, I was only given 2 hours notice. About 20 minutes later I received a voicemail saying that their horse rangler is sick so they must cancel and to call back to confirm we received this message. She did not apologize whatsoever.

I called about 30 times before I could get ahold of anyone. When someone finally answered, I asked if there was anyone else available to guide the tour because my friend was leaving the next day and she said no. Still she did not apologize. I explained to her how I thought it was inappropriate for her to send a text to cancel and she responded with ""well I asked you to call me back"" and when I told her I called about 30 times and no one answered she replied ""well I saw you beeping on the other line but I was on the phone booking other tours"" Her responses were contradicting and rude so I started yelling at her and only then did she start apologizing.

PARKING: I think they have their own private lot, as it is inside the Ellis Island Hotel and Casino. I ended up just walking here because my hotel was right behind it.

LOCATION: Located inside Ellis Island. You'll see it past the casino, right beside the karoke bar.

RESERVATIONS: I think you can make reservations through Yelp, but I saw that there was no wait time, so I ended up coming here without a reservation. Once I got to the hostess, she told me that there was about 45 minutes for 3 people, which I thought was kind of dumb, but I decided to wait anyway. I ended up getting seated within 15 minutes!

RESTAURANT: Very casual dine-in kind of restaurant. It kind of reminds me of a typical casino cafe in Vegas. You just come to grab a quick meal for the night. There were plenty of booths and long tables for large parties. My friends and I got our own booth.

MENU: I was very impressed with the selection of food which varies from burgers to pasta, but my attention was drawn towards their prime rib special for about $17.99. The special came with a side of green beans, and a choice of mashed or baked potatoes or french fries, and soup or salad. It may not sound a lot, but it's actually enough to share between two people.

I ended up sharing mine with my roommate, and we barely ate through half of the prime rib. The prime rib was large and cooked a nice medium rare for us. I thought it was very tender and juicy, not bad for the cheap price! The mashed potatoes were delicious; the gravy was savory and tasted amazing with the potatoes. The green beans were okay and the salad was standard.

CONCLUSION: Definitely a decent place to stop by if you're staying nearby. The prime rib special is hard to pass, considering how much food they give you and the quality isn't so bad either! Good for leftovers as well if you're planning to save a little extra money in Vegas. However, service can be a bit slow, so be prepared for that!",12/24/2018 19:06,36.11682093,-115.0934173,3754 E Flamingo Rd,NV,Las Vegas,89121,"Chocolatiers & Shops, Specialty Food, Food, Gift Shops, Flowers & Gifts, Florists, Shopping",,Food,1,Restaurants_Food,Shopping,,,Restaurants_FoodShopping,Edible Arrangements

We've had numerous prior experiences there, and found this restaurant to be very good for food quality, price & service.  However, our recent experience is one to be forgotten, and never to return.  It started when we were seated in a booth.  Upon being seated when trying to read the menu, I noticed that all the lights along the top were non-functional, and we had nothing to light our table except one dimly lit table light about the power of a small penlight.  I asked the waiter if he would please turn on the overhead lamps so we could see the menu.  After a short absence, he returned to say that they were not working, and so basically, ""too bad"".  So, we proceeded to pass the table light around, and order our meals.  I had a ribeye steak, other individuals ordered the Atlantic Salmon, lamb chops, and shrimp scampi.  Comments to the food: my ribeye steak was just ""okay"" and nothing special.  It was actually a bit on the tough side, and not very tasty, but just ok.  However, when my sister got her shrimp scampi, it was COLD.  It was cold to the touch, and definitely had been sitting around the kitchen way too long before being brought to the table.  We immediately complained to the server, and she said, ""let me take it back, and heat it up"".  She took the dish back to the kitchen, to be heated up & brought back few minutes later.  It was a bit warmer, but it was still just ""luke warm"" and definitely not how a main dish should be served.  However, my sister decided against sending it back again, for fear that the kitchen staff might get upset, and do something ""bad"" to the dish.  In all my experiences dining at better restaurants, if there is something wrong with the dish(cold food inclusive), the dish was completely re-prepared and brought out fresh, hot & served to order, with an apology for the mistake.  As a matter of fact, many restaurants that I frequent at home would go one step further, and comp the meal as an offset to their mistake.  Neither action was taken by Redwood staff.  We also realized that the reason they could not heat the shrimp scampi back to piping hot was because the shrimps would then be ""overcooked"" and very tough.  So it seemed that the kitchen crew took the action of cheap, quickest fix, and least effort on their part.  For that reason, and our overall poor experience at the Redwood Bar & Grill, we will not ever return to this establishment.  Had they done anything to correct their mistakes, or even offered a sincere apology and made the effort to correct the food, we might feel differently.  Las Vegas has many restaurants that serve great food, and the service is good as well.  Redwood needs to do much better training of both kitchen & service staff, fix their physical facilities so everything works right, and teach their people how to graciously accept & correct any mistakes made in food preparation.  Hopefully, someone that has a sincere interest in RB&G will read this & take it to heart.

I went there a year ago and sat at the bar and noticed a very loud fan in the beverage cooler (like 70 or 80 db loud).
Went back 2 months later.Still broke. 
And 3 months later,nope,still broke.

Last time I was there,it was finally fixed,but this is a sit sown restaurant in a very large casino and you can't get that fixed for nearly a year?

By that time I didn't really feel like eating anything anymore (got the wings to go and ate later, they were pretty good!) 

I'm not really sure what was going on after that but our waitress seemed to be ignoring us, she passed by us multiple times without stopping even when we tried to get her attention, at times we had to wait 20 minutes to have our water glasses refilled.

At the price tag of 175.00 per head (advanced purchase) most people would run away. A tasting event for the price of a 12 course french meal with wine pairing would make you think twice until you saw the lineup planned by Bon Appetit at  Caesars Palace's pool in Las Vegas. 

This was no ordinary 'taste of' event as seen in other cities that occupy fairgrounds. Caesars' pools were setup for this private tasting event with over 100 restaurants, wineries, and shops exhibiting I picked up a wine glass at the door to get started. 

Many of the restaurants had the creators, celebrity chefs, and head chefs preparing the food. Each booth had bite sized servings of one of a few of their dishes they wanted to show off. Everything was spectacular and even the worse dish was excellent. 

At one point in the night there was a traffic jam causing some congestion making it a great time to step away to the lounge and relax with a glass of wine.  The event was a total success, a true epicurean experience I walked out of there full, fat, happy, exhausted, and content!

I left this same review on Audi Henderson yelp page as I am an owner of 2 Audi's and a Lamborghni Huracan. They share the same roof, same service advisor and the same service manger. 

The ""service department"" is ran by multiple clowns. I feel like I'm visiting a zoo every time i put my foot inside the door. Bunch of uneducated monkeys working there. Ben and Bryce are the biggest r*tards to ever work at Audi Henderson. Don't trust them to work on your car. They will do whatever it is to VOID your warranty and scam you for money. If they treat you unfair, get a lawyer and get it handle.

They also love to FAVORITE their customers. They treat one person different than the other. They're always so quick to blame the customer for everything. To top it all off, they have the biggest technician turnover rate EVER! You simply cannot trust who is working on your car. They've REHIRED ""technicians"" that has been fired from Lamborghini Las Vegas tech department for unlawfully sharing customer information and posting videos & pictures of clients cars on YouTube without clients consent. And EVEN to the extent of shop foremans crashing Audi R8's and not taking full responsibility for their actions. They get a slap on the wrist and demoted while were supposed to trust them to work on our cars. 

Last but not least, I've got my car washed after a service and I've received my car completely scratched up. Hood, bumper and the the roof and i got pictures to prove it with time stamps. They simply didn't want to take the responsibility. Seriously, this place is turned into a circus. Like I said, avoid the service department at all costs even if you have to go in for warranty work. Get extended warranty like i did and take your car to RTM performance. You'll get treated with respect and your car will get fixed faster. Oh yea, don't leave your car overnight also. They love to take your car on ""joy rides"". 

- Hey Bryce, stop scamming innocent customers so you can hit your monthly quota. you need to retire already. Next time you want to be a tough guy don't send your ""step"" son Ben Stauffer to relay the message LOL. If you have something to say to me, call me or invite me over ;)
Don't be a wuss bud! I personally know solid technicians that left to Mercedes Benz of Henderson because of YOU! Your sh*tty personality & your laziness is why this service department is FALLING APART. Technicians who are currently working there hates you. You treat them like crap, the same way you treat the customers. McDonalds is always hiring BTW. Might be a better career change. 


Last but not least, plz check your mileage and do your research like I've done ;)",9/22/2018 16:02,36.16717891,-115.2859991,"410 S Rampart Blvd, Ste 165",NV,Las Vegas,89145,"Event Planning & Services, Cards & Stationery, Arts & Crafts, Flowers & Gifts, Shopping, Gift Shops, Art Supplies",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Paper Source

We got there around 10:30 on a Friday night, and it was packed in that huge restaurant! Luckily, no long pho Kim wait for us, and we were seated within minutes. 

One aspect of this pho joint that stood out from any other pho place I've been to is their excellent service. Everyone that came by was so friendly, even though the restaurant was packed and busy. Usually I feel like I'm always being rushed, but never did we feel like they were trying to turn tables like a mother pho'cker. 

My wife and I both got the rare beef pho and an order of egg rolls. The egg rolls weren't the greatest, but the rare beef pho was pretty pho'ckin good (probably tasted better cuz we were super hungry and haven't had pho in awhile). The broth was also pretty hearty and flavorful.

As usual, Yelpers were right on the money, this place is FANTASTIC!  Can't recommend it enough - if you're craving Mexican, go to Juan's and you'll have a great meal at a perfect price!

I honestly enjoyed every single thing we ate - the chips (fresh), the salsa (perfect), the soup they automatically serve before your entree, the fajitas, the dips, everything.  I will say it was all slightly on the salty side - but I *love* salt so that's right up my alley.  We ordered the chicken fajitas for 2 and, along with the free chips and salsa, and the tomato-based soup that comes out first, it ended up being 4 meals for the hubs and I.  Well worth the money.  And again, it was all so, so delicious!

The hosts and servers were all super friendly and helpful and everything was brought out quickly.  We honestly don't have a single complaint - except that we didn't go here sooner!

For some reason, I'm comp'ed here.  I think they have me confused for someone else, but I do play at the $10 tables and run a Martingale - can bet up to $80.  So the room is free and the food/drinks are all inclusive.  Can't beat that.

When we checked in at 10:30 PM, my wife asked for a high level.  We got put onto floor 30 with a view of the Strip.  That was excellent and unexpected with such a late check in.

There's a Gilley's and a Kahunaville that we went to.  The Gilley's was a lot of fun: the Stephanie Eason band was playing and they were doing a pretty excellent set of Miranda Lambert, so it was easy to get into.

Then, at the Craps table, I ran into a unique experience.  I was making regular bets of come and then odds.  Then I am leaving the odds working for the come out roll.  Anyhow, I'm excited (high fives and such) about winning the last point (a 6) and I forgot the odds bet on the 6, much less having it work.  So the come out roll is... a 6.  I should have been a winner if I kept doing what I was doing.  But then, a twilight zone moment occurs and the dealer to my left kind of leans forward, about to pay me off but there's no bet, when he says, ""well, he MEANT to bet it.  Hold up!  The player over here has been making the same bet all afternoon and he would have bet the six and had the odds working.""  There's a brief discussion, not too long and boom - here comes $34 my way, for THE BET I WOULD HAVE MADE.  

I have never been paid for a bet I never made before.  But I tip the dealers in craps which is rare.  (how come nobody does - these guys have special brains being able to keep track of 10 different peoples' bets at once).  Anyhow, I tip even more afterwards, about another $15.  The boxman, who has a sense of humor, says ""so you got your little quid-pro-quo going again I see, Charlie"" and we keep rolling winners.  Fun group - like rolling with your buddies.

Last story, I sent in my sports book tickets in the mail.  A day later, the local post office sends back a shred of the envelope with a message ""sorry, your mail was damaged"".  Well, I thought the mail was swiped.  I google on line for advice and one person says, ""well if you know the hotel exec, you might have a 0.1% chance of getting paid.   In a desperate moment, I call the Treasure Island accounting department anyway and Dena, the best employee of all time, takes the run down from me, puts a stop payment on the mailed in tickets so that no one will cash them and makes the arrangements to meet with her boss to pay off based on an electronic scanned copy of the winning tickets!  Turns out this is not needed; a day later, she calls me back saying the tickets arrived, flopping out of a now open envelope, but intact just the same.  Expect the check in 3-5 days.  I wish I could have tipped her, for the diligence, follow-up.",12/22/2011 18:11,36.15916609,-115.3445358,,NV,Las Vegas,89148,"Professional Services, Personal Assistants, Home & Garden, Business Consulting, Home Decor, Shopping, Home Services, Home Organization",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Organized by Ginger

The casino itself was much more well ventilated compared to some of the other ones downtown. I did not play any table games but the few machines I did play where just okay. It has a smaller selection of penny slots compared to other downtown casinos. 

The room is nice (not that I spent a lot of time in the room). One of the more interesting things I noticed about the room was how modern it was. The alarm clock and tv looked brand new. The room lived up to what the pictures where shown to be. One of the more interesting things I noticed about the room was that the bathroom door had no lock on. This likely isn't a big deal if you are going with someone you trust but it could make for some interesting surprises.II didn't watch the tv with the exception of the end of the NCAA title game and the TV picture quality was quite poor but only on that station oddly enough. 

The only other thing that I didn't care much for was that where my room was located you could hear all the action at night/early in the morning. I just turned on the AC unit to drown out the noise as it was rather mild at night. 

Overall would stay again. I had no other issues. I didn't do any real eating or gambling at the nugget.

My friends were so gracious to book me tickets to one of the shows. This was my first time in Vegas (after turning 21) and it was a great experience!

We decided to meet up at Crush for drinks and appetizers before the show. I ordered a sangria for myself and we shared dumplings, pizza, and tomato salad.

The sangria was good, but not great. My friends said their favorite was the tomato salad. The food was delicious and I was told certain courses were much better, but we didn't have time to stay for dinner.

Service was ok. We were seated by the front next to a noisy table, but they left when our food arrived.

Overall, I would say it's a great place to grab a quick bite before the show. Just make sure you book a reservation, otherwise you will end up waiting an hour or so. I enjoy the ambiance, but will have to come back a second time to determine if it's worth it.

My home warranty company (Old Republic) was useless.  They told me they could maybe have someone over there by 2:30pm.  By that time, the ceiling and walls would've totally caved in and I could have been looking at an insane mold problem.   I ended up calling a bunch of plumbing companies to see who could come out the fastest and one was able to get there in 20 minutes.  One of the water pipes coming from upstairs was cracked (nice looking out, fucking home inspector) and the plumber recommended AFR to assess the damage.  I am sure he got a nice kickback out of it but I needed someone ASAP to get this on the right track and they were able to come in less than 30 minutes.  

They ended up taking down half the ceiling and about 30% of the walls of the garage.  The guys then set up 3 industrial sized dehumidifiers downstairs and 3 upstairs which sat there for a week to ensure everything would be dry before repair could begin.  Everyone I dealt with from the guy doing the estimates to the crew that set up everything was great.

We wake up to a slightly stuffy house and I start looking at the air conditioner. Notice all the lines are frozen, including the ones to the outside unit. Turn off unit and let it start thawing out, wife starts calling a/c repair people. Mr Cool has a same day opening, so we take it. 5 minutes of looking and they replace the blower motor for $650... It is a $150-200 part, so $400 for 1.5 hrs of work seems a bit steep for hourly rate. On top of that, I come home from work and the floor around the air handler is all wet, so I pull apart all the tape that closes out the access panel to the coils and lo and behold the pan drain is clogged. I guess fixing the symptoms of a problem is easier than fixing the actual problem then the secondary effects of the problem. I wonder how long this new overpriced motor would have lasted in the rain coming from the pan above it. Would recommend for routine maintenance, not a troubleshooting/diagnosis type service.  As clarification, my air handler has the coils and pan above the blower motor, the motor was dripping with water, so I would assume that the clogged pan dripping water on an electric motor would cause the motor to fail, none of the wiring is sealed, I understand that if a motor is bad it needs to be changed, but the problem was a clogged drain line which caused a motor to fail.

For me personally, this is especially the case with beer since it is literally possible to purchase individual bottles of hundreds if not thousands of different beer varieties to come up with unique custom-designed 6-packs ad infinitum. You will need multiple lifetimes to consume it all!

Total Wine & More is definitely worth a trip if for no other reason than to be astounded by the  vast variety of alcoholic beverages consumed by people throughout the world.

The people that run this place have no managerial experience ... They sell soccer shoes, clothing and accessories but constantly change everything around, one week stuff is there being sold next week its all gone,  the week after they only have shoes???? Now they sell metro phones inside? 

Soccer matches are disorganized ... For example there have been times when the other teams have cancelled.. And we were never told.. Everyone shows up and we are told to wait 30 mins just in case that by some miracle a team shows up to play against us...   :( also I guess some people here have connections to the owners and they can pick and choose who refs for their games...

A definite plus, this hotel is very dog-friendly and unlike the other hotels on the strip, there wasn't a trace of smoke in the lobby. The parking situation is valet-only, which makes it easy to get around, but a pain if you're in a hurry since you could be waiting for 5-10 minutes.

I was kind of on a fence because there are mixed reviews here, but I am so glad I went to see it. The theater is amazing. The performance is spectacular. I have seen many cirque type shows in Vegas, and I think this was the best one. I enjoyed every second of it. Some reviewers have said that there was not a clear story line in this show, but honestly, it didn't bother me at all. I was just amazed by all the acrobatics and thoroughly entertained. The muscular twin put on a fantastic show. They did some of the craziest sh*t I've ever seen. The music also set the mood perfectly. 

I know this is supposedly similar to O and there is much debate over which is better. I saw O loooong time ago, so I don't think I should be making comparison now, but I remember I was sleepy during O and excited during Le Reve.

This post is strictly towards my interactions with the assistant service manager of Las Vegas BMW. When you see this title I automatically assumed I would get good customer service from him and I was absolutely wrong. 

He assumed we bought our car at a rinky-dink dealership and the SUV came from Acura one lot from them. Once I told him I got it from Acura that's when he decided to take us to his desk. This took place at the entrance into the service department we didn't even make it to the desk with his behaviors and reactions when we were trying to explain what were told his behavior made me feel I don't belong there. The under tones, body language and verbal interactions towards me from the time I walked in was completely unprofessional. I don't know the names, terms, warranties, and whatever else goes in detail in the deals when you are closing on the deal. I was trying to buy extended warranty and I was told NO. I asked him about the maintenance plan I was told no since I didn't buy the car from their dealership. After demoralizing me that if I had hard cold cash as he's pointing and slamming his finger on the contract and repleting if I paid  cold cash I can get the maintenance package. Other then that there's nothing he could do for me at all. He judged me and my family from the time we walked in to the  time we left. 

I understand the SUV can't get CPO warranty, and after the other dealership called me while I was there I'm repleting the question and asking to buy extended warranty he said no. 

I went to BMW Henderson today and their finance department helped me purchase my extended warranty and I will be sitting down with him in the future to go to the maintenance plan thank you BMW Henderson. Sometime people are asking for something simple but has the terminology mixed up/meaning. This happened to me on Saturday at BMW Las Vegas, so instead of saying NO the entire time - Just stop for a second and try to recap and slow down and walking through the process to make sure everyone is on the same page. The end result is I got my extended warranty else.",10/1/2019 4:23,36.149751,-115.0762536,,NV,Las Vegas,89104,"Contractors, Home Services, Shopping, Handyman, Kitchen & Bath, Home & Garden, Painters, Flooring, Drywall Installation & Repair",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Medina Remodel LV

Walked through an open door way with the door broken off the hinges and propped up against the wall outside. So it was a bit drafty inside and we walked to be moved further from the door... we were sat directly to the left of the open door maybe two tables down. After we were moved it was less drafty but still on the cool side. This was the day we had the snow storm for 2.5 minutes. We got our usual with the addition to the deep fried tofu. The pad Thai came back with a chemical taste and wasn't edible. So that was a bummer. Seemed like they're didn't properly clean or let burn off whatever cleaner was being used. So we then split the veggie basil. Towards my last bite I wasn't sure if it tasted odd or maybe it was just cold at that point. Our Thai tea was even a different color... we thought it might have been a different batch or bottom of the batch scenario. It tasted normal for the most part but the coloring was darker than the norm. Other tables had the same and no complaints so we over looked it. The service was still good. Never had a complaint about the service though!!

Mirage did a great job finding someone to replace Danny Gans.  I am positive that any fans of Gans will love Fator.  Not sure of vice versa but that doesn't matter.

I ordered the Pastrami Reuben with pastrami, swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and sandwich sauce. My boyfriend order the Chipotle Chicken Avocado with grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce and chipotle sauce. We had half of each other's sandwiches so we can taste it. Boy, it was soooo good I wanted more after I finished each half! It was like just enough to make you wanting more. Ugh, such a tease. I wish the sandwiches were bigger because I was still hungry.

The steam rooms were quite interesting; it was very hard to see upon walking into the herbal steam room, so I had no idea if anyone else was in it or not since the steam is so thick. Luckily, that room did wonders for my nose since the desert heat was wrecking havoc on me. It was the first time all week that I could breathe properly.

So we went up to ask and was told 'yea, they're not gluten free she didn't mean to say that but instead of coming to tell you she just wasn't going to go back to your table cause she thought you guys were done'......wait. What?

I usually get the #1 Hoi Nam chicken (white meat) for $5.50, which I recommend. The dark meat is better taste wise but white meat obviously healthier. The yellow rice is very good (not greasy at all) and remember to use the sauce. The waiter recommended the #15 Beef Tendon Ramen, which I thought was average. The broth was OK, the noodles itself were generic. The brisket was good and tender but the tendon pieces were too rough and hard to be edible.

To the OG in Orange County to Nor Cal's Sacramento location, and I must say, it is just as good as everyone says it is.

Can't go wrong with a pound of shrimp, whole shabang (it's all the flavors combined) and I go mild, because that's about a good kick without ruining my food. You know that song? The one that goes ""My milkshakes bring the boys to the yard""? Well The Boiling Crab's shrimps brings the girls to the yard. 

Feeling bougie? You can't go wrong with the King Crab legs, they're by order so the weight is gonna vary and it can a little pricey, but yo, these are off the chain! Hella meat! Dippin' it in that whole shabang saucey sauce! You gotta spend money to make money and the next day, I got that raise! Now I'm always gettin' the King Crab legs! 

And service? Amazing service! Management is always so kind to me, asking me how I'm doing, if I'm enjoying myself, which I always am. I'm always greeted with a smile, what more could you ask for?

We've been several times and always come away full and happy.  We left not too long ago from a good-bye dinner with our friends to enjoy a final night out before my husband is deployed.  We were over half an hour late (we did call to let them know!) and they were still as friendly as could be and we were immediately seated.  The menus had special inserts that said ""Happy Birthday and Be Safe!"" (it was a birthday dinner, too!), ribbons were on the table, everyone who came by wished him happy birthday, and his celebration dessert was delicious and impeccably decorated.  Our waitress then took our picture and had it printed and brought it out for us.  I could not ask for anything more.
I have tried many things on the menu and always been impressed.  This time I asked for a dish normally included as part of another appetizer to be served on its own, and they did it without even blinking, and it was of course delicious.  I would recommend the appetizer boat for two, the mahi-mahi, and any surf-and-turf combo available because they've all been stellar.  Our friend enjoyed the butterfish, he said he cannot wait to return to eat it again.
Desserts are my favourite part, everything was soooo yummy!  The dessert portions are kind of small but I like that, as I'm usually too stuffed by the end of a meal to enjoy a large dessert, and their taste perfection makes up for anything they lack in size.  (And to be honest, they aren't even that small.  It's just moreso places like the Cheesecake Factory serve such large dessert portions that when I see a normal one I'm like, ""Hey, what's this white space on my plate??"")

I was extremely lucky to work for some generational talents along the way, while its been 20 plus years since I worked in London, I worked for a chef that when food looked perfect and tasted prefect he would us the term ""That's like sex on a plate"" to describe it.

 I have no words to describe the food other than, It was sex on a plate.

 My wide and I ate there for our wedding anniversary on our annual Vegas trip. It was taken a couple of year for us to be able to get a reservation during our trip but it was worth the wait.

 It is as so many point out expensive however for 16 plates that were amazing I don't feel it was that crazy when Sage at Aria is 1/4 of the price for 7 courses Picasso at the Bellagio is3/4 of the price for 8 courses. You pay for what you get.

 From the moment they open the door for you the highest level of service is given to you. The bread selection when it is brought to you is almost over whelming but not to worry they will bring more and more, you can try as much as you want but take caution, it you are a true foodie and you opt for the full 16 course chefs menu don't fill up on bread.

 One of the amazing things that I noticed was each persons place is cleared one at a time, there was no stacking of plates and silverware after each course. Not once during you evening did I hear plates clink not the jingle of silverware on plates either.

The drink service was prompt as well.

If you liked the old buffet at Rampart, you certainly will like this one and the price (if you have a players card ) is much lower than most buffets. For a low additional fee, you can opt for all you can drink beer or wine as well.

The door was unlocked and the owner happened to be inside. He asked when the cooks would be ready to take their first order and they said now, so boom, they took me before they opened! Ha.

Anyway, the decor in here is a kind of industrial and the atmosphere is a kind of hip but unpretentious modern nerdy, with nods to anime, the arts, gaming, music, and the like. I dig it, but older folks might not.

The staff's friendly, but not TOO friendly, and I mean that in the best of ways for me personally. I, a milennial, don't appreciate fake smiles and forced laughs. The staff is a more realistic kind of friendly: they're there working, not trying to weave some illusion that they couldn't wait for me to walk in the door and throw me a party with burgers I had to pay for. Again, this is a vibe that actually has charm to people in my age range but older people might find sort of curt.

And lastly, the food: honestly, these my favorite burgers. I've had three of their eight unique offerings and I've liked all three, but I love the chicken katsu burger, with the spicy karai burger a close second. At about 8 dollars, you get very solid value on the burgers, but the fries are a little pricy by comparison ($3 I believe?). I don't really eat fries anyway, but my girlfriend ordered some once and they're really good... but I still don't eat fries or drink soda, so it's just a burger for me when I go in.

All around, I'd strongly recommend Fukuburger to anyone in my own age range (millenial) or younger (Gen Z, as they call them), or anyone else that's fairly modern in their tastes and expectations. I'm not sure the vibe inside would appeal to seniors and older generations, but they'd still love the burgers, because they're awesome.",2/13/2019 20:51,36.0326059,-114.9825085,143 S Water St,NV,Henderson,89015,"Shopping, Doctors, Eyewear & Opticians, Health & Medical, Optometrists",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Clear Vision Eye Centers - Water Street

After moving to Mountain's edge there wasn't a lifetime close enough that could keep me going to the gym as frequent as I wanted to. So I canceled my membership and joined EOS because they have a great price. I paid a little extra to get the towel service.

Pros: They have a good variety of equipment that is maintained well. It's never too busy when I go first thing in the morning. Their customer service is great! Kristina W and Sydney are very friendly and both have gone above and beyond to accommodate me. They were having a towel supply issue for a couple months. Both on different days, went in the back to try to find me a towel and 2 out of 3 times they delivered. I'm a germaphobe and it's flu/cold season so that meant a lot to me. If I could give them both five stars I would but this is not just about customer service.

Cons: there seems to be a maintenance issue when it comes to things like towels paper towel dispensers sanitizer etc. To run out of towels regularly when it's required to have one to work out and charge people extra for the luxury of having one available to them is unacceptable. If there's an issue with towels it needs to be dealt with immediately. It was at least a month or two that they went by without proper towel supply. You're dealing with hygiene.  Last  week two different towel dispensers were down. It's a requirement for us to wipe the machines down with sanitizer after use. I highly suggest keeping back up if they're breaking or back up batteries if the batteries are going out or ordering more paper goods if you're running out of paper towels regardless, this is something that's completely avoidable and it needs to be more important to the management overseeing it.

My review of this place is long overdue after countless times of going here.  Honestly, I think the only reason I'm not giving them 2-stars is because the cafe serves its purpose; you get in, sit, get your tea (or if you're craving for street food, by all means, have at it), and then you get out.

It's very convenient to get your drink to go, and they give somewhat prompt service.  But their service when it comes to sit-in is horrendous.

Along with the trash-talking in Mandarin about customers, they're pretty deficient on the hospitality department.

Short story- one time I went there and our bill came to around $15.  We gave her $25 since we had big bills.  It does NOT make sense to keep the change.  $10 tip?  Are you kidding me?  We had to ask her for the change and when she gave it to us, it was short a couple dollars and cents.  We left no tip.

(Just so you know me a bit better, I tend not to tip ONLY if the service is ridiculous.  I've never NOT given any tip because of bad food, that's something we risk as customers.  But in a city where the tip percentage is among the highest in the nation, I believe that the tip should be a reflection of the establishment's hospitality.  Thus, she received no tip.)",1/25/2012 4:53,36.2259753,-115.2193439,3690 N Rancho Dr,NV,Las Vegas,89130,"Shopping, Fabric Stores, Arts & Crafts",,,,,Shopping,,,Shopping,Sew Yeah Quilting

Please don't order the $16 scallops - wish I had taken a photo - 3 tiny scallops on an enormous platter.  Other food was ok, but it's very overpriced for the quantity and quality.  Then the real shocker:  we get the bill.  Our first beers were $2.  Our last 2 beers were $7 and $10.  Apparently we ordered them after the game.  Wish someone had told us.  

Update:  We were contacted immediately by the manager, Ian.  He was courteous and professional.  He listened to our complaints, and I'm sure will work to improve.  We were issued a full refund.

Due to the size of our party, I got to experience several of the dishes on the menu.  I would say that about half were very good, and the remaining were well below par.  They either hit it out of the park or struck out on each dish.  The dishes that failed were not properly balanced (either too salty, too tart, or too sweet).  The restaurant seemed to be well staffed, however the service was incredibly slow.  Our dinner lasted 3.5 hours, which was insane.  For a better sushi experience (and much more reasonably priced) I would recommend either Pier 215 or SOHO.  If you are going to try Yonaka, keep your party small and keep you expectations in check.

First time we went they had recently opened and service was subpar. I figured it was due to working out the kinks and didn't think too much of it. The gluten free prix fixe dinner selection and gluten free blonde ale beer I can't seem to find in the stores in Vegas definitely made up for the lack of service. Went again two more times and service did not improve. The last visit after we had already ordered and waited 20 minutes, we were brought plates for our dinner and proceeded to sit there waiting for our food for an additional 10 minutes.

I wouldn't categorize her as the best, she was decent. At times, I felt as if she was zoning out and just rubbing the same area over and over again with no pressure. That didn't bother me too much. The reason for the 1 star was that when I paid, I left her a $5 tip. She then ran after me in the parking lot asking why I left her only $5! I guess 25% is not ok?? She was clearly angry and I said ""I'm sorry, what?"" I was in shock that I was being followed to my car for a $5 tip. 

If 50% tips are mandatory then it should be posted somewhere (which in itself is ridiculous). So just word of advice: either give 50% tip or there is a possibility you'll get jumped in the parking lot.
